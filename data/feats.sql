You gain the trained proficiency rank in Crafting and Religion. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

(7,1,"36","Boulder Roll","Your dwarven build allows you to push foes around, just like a mighty boulder tumbles through a subterranean cavern. Take a Step into the square of a foe that is your size or smaller, and the foe must move into the empty space directly behind it. The foe must move even if doing so places it in harm’s way. The foe can attempt a Fortitude saving throw against your Athletics DC to block your Step. If the foe attempts this saving throw, unless it critically succeeds, it takes bludgeoning damage equal to your level plus your Strength modifier."),

(19,1,"40","Ageless Patience","You work at a pace born from longevity that enhances your thoroughness. You can voluntarily spend twice as much time as normal on a Perception check or skill check to gain a +2 circumstance bonus to that check. You also don’t treat a natural 1 as worse than usual on these checks; you get a critical failure only if your result is 10 lower than the DC. For example, you could get these benefits if you spent 2 actions to Seek, which normally takes 1 action. You can get these benefits during exploration by taking twice as long exploring as normal, or in downtime by spending twice as much downtime."),

This lasts until your Ancestral Longevity expires."),
(23,1,"41","Universal Longevity","You’ve perfected your ability to keep up with all the skills you’ve learned over your long life, so you’re almost never truly untrained at a skill. You reflect on your life experiences, changing the skills you selected with Elven Longevity and Expert Longevity."),

(44,1,"48","Junk Tinker","You can make useful tools out of even twisted or rusted scraps. When using the Crafting skill to Craft, you can make level 0 items, including weapons but not armor, out of junk.

You also become trained in Halfling Lore."),
(54,1,"52","Halfling Luck","Your happy-go-lucky nature makes it seem like misfortune avoids you, and to an extent, that might even be true. You can reroll the triggering check, but you must use the new result, even if it’s worse than your first roll."),

Whenever you roll a success on a check to Escape or a saving throw against an effect that would impose the grabbed or restrained condition on you, you get a critical success instead.

You gain the Adopted Ancestry general feat, and you also gain one 1st-level ancestry feat from the ancestry you chose for the Adopted Ancestry feat."),
(61,1,"53","Halfling Weapon Trickster","You are particularly adept at fighting with your people’s favored weapons. Whenever you critically succeed at an attack roll using a shortsword, a sling, or a halfling weapon, you apply the weapon’s critical specialization effect."),
(62,1,"53","Guiding Luck","Your luck guides you to look the right way and aim your blows unerringly. You can use Halfling Luck twice per day: once in response to its normal trigger, and once when you fail a Perception check or attack roll instead of the normal trigger."),
(63,1,"53","Irrepressible","You are easily able to ward off attempts to play on your fears and emotions.

You can cast this cantrip as a spell of your class’s tradition."),

(69,1,"57","Haughty Obstinacy","Your powerful ego makes it harder for others to order you around. If you roll a success on a saving throw against a mental effect that attempts to directly control your actions, you critically succeed instead.

Choose a cantrip or 1st-level spell from the same magical tradition as your cantrip from Adapted Cantrip. You gain that spell, adding it to your spell repertoire, spellbook, or prepared spells just like the cantrip from Adapted Spell. You can cast this spell as a spell of your class’s magical tradition. If you choose a 1st-level spell, you don’t gain access to the heightened versions of that spell, meaning you can’t prepare them if you prepare spells and you can’t learn them or select the spell as a signature spell if you have a spell repertoire."),
(74,1,"57","Clever Improviser","You’ve learned how to handle situations when you’re out of your depth. You gain the Untrained Improvisation general feat. In addition, you can attempt skill actions that normally require you to be trained, even if you are untrained."),
(75,1,"57","Cooperataive Soul","You have developed a soul-deep bond with your comrades and maintain an even greater degree of cooperation with them. If you are at least an expert in the skill you are Aiding, you get a success on any outcome rolled to Aid other than a critical success."),

You may also have been raised among elves, steeped in your elven ancestors’ heritage. You gain the benefits of the elf heritage of your elven parent or ancestors. You typically can’t select a heritage that depends on or improves an elven feature you don’t have. For example, you couldn’t gain the cavern elf’s darkvision ability if you didn’t have low-light vision. In these cases, at the GM’s discretion, you might gain a different benefit."),
(80,1,"58","Inspire Imitation","Your own actions inspire your allies to great achievements.

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy checks against non-humanoid intelligent creatures and against humanoids that are marginalized in human society (at the GM’s discretion, but typically at least including giants, goblins, kobolds, and orcs). You also gain this bonus on Perception checks to Sense the Motives of such creatures."),

(92,1,"76","Alchemical Familiar","You have used alchemy to create life, a simple creature formed from alchemical materials, reagents, and a bit of your own blood. This alchemical familiar appears to be a small creature of flesh and blood, though it might have some unusual or distinguishing aspects depending on your creative process. Like other familiars, your alchemical familiar assists you in your laboratory and on adventures. The familiar uses your Intelligence modifier to determine its Perception, Acrobatics, and Stealth modifiers (see Familiars for more information)."),
(93,1,"76","Alchemical Savant","You can identify alchemical items quickly. When using the Crafting skill to Identify Alchemy on an alchemical item you hold, you can do so as a single action, which has the concentrate and manipulate traits, instead of spending 10 minutes. If you have the formula for the item you are attempting to identify, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check, and if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead."),
(94,1,"76","Far Lobber","You’ve learned how to throw a longer distance. When you throw an alchemical bomb, it has a range increment of 30 feet instead of the usual 20 feet."),

(98,1,"77","Smoke Bomb","You cause the bomb to create a cloud of thick smoke, in addition to its normal effects. When thrown, the bomb creates a cloud of smoke in a 10-foot-radius burst.

Creatures within that area have the concealed condition, and all other creatures are concealed to them. The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dissipated by a strong wind."),

(100,1,"77","Efficient Alchemy","Thanks to the time you’ve spent studying and experimenting, you know how to scale your formulas into larger batches that don’t require any additional attention. When spending downtime to Craft alchemical items, you can produce twice as many alchemical items in a single batch without spending additional preparatory time. For instance, if you are creating elixirs of life, you can craft up to eight elixirs in a single batch using downtime, rather than four. This does not reduce the amount of alchemical reagents required or other ingredients needed to craft each item, nor does it increase your rate of progress for days past the base downtime spent. This also does not change the number of items you can create in a batch using advanced alchemy."),
(101,1,"78","Enduring Alchemy","You’ve learned how to make your personal energy last just a little bit longer when quickly brewing ad hoc concoctions. When using Quick Alchemy to create an alchemical tool or elixir, that tool or elixir remains potent until the end of your next turn, instead of losing its potency at the start of your next turn."),

(653,1,"211","Clever Counterspell","You creatively apply your prepared spells to Counterspell a much wider variety of your opponents’ magic. Instead of being able to counter a foe’s spell with Counterspell only if you have that same spell prepared, you can use Counterspell as long as you have the spell the foe is casting in your spellbook. When you use Counterspell in this way, the prepared spell you expend must share a trait other than its tradition with the triggering spell. At the GM’s discretion, you can instead use a spell that has an opposing trait or that otherwise logically would counter the triggering spell (such as using a cold or water spell to counter fireball or using remove fear to counter a fear spell). Regardless of what spell you expend, you take a –2 penalty to your counteract check, though the GM can waive this penalty if the expended spell is especially appropriate."),

However, your tinkering weakens the spell’s integrity, reducing its remaining duration by half."),

Once during your daily preparations, you can use a spell slot to hold that infinite potential, rather than using it to prepare a spell. You can use this spell slot to cast any spell from your spellbook that’s at least 2 levels lower than the slot you designate; the spell acts in all ways as a spell of 2 levels lower. You don’t have any particular spell prepared in that slot until you cast it."),
(661,1,"212","Reprepare Spell","You’ve discovered how to reuse some of your spell slots over and over.

You can reprepare a spell in this way even if you’ve already reprepared that spell previously in the same day. If you have the spell substitution arcane thesis, you can instead prepare a different spell in an expended slot, as long as the new spell doesn’t have a duration. Once you’ve reprepared a spell in that slot even once, you can use your arcane thesis to substitute only spells without durations into that spell slot."),

When you prepare your spells, you can fill a combination slot with a combination of two spells. Each spell in the combination must be 2 or more spell levels below the slot’s level, and both must target only one creature or object or have the option to target only one creature or object. Each spell in the combination must also have the same means of determining whether it has an effect—both spells must require a ranged spell attack roll, require the same type of saving throw, or automatically affect the target."),

If you’re a master in Stealth, the GM uses the number rolled or 15, and if you’re legendary in Stealth, you automatically succeed at hiding a small concealed item from passive observers.

If you’re legendary in Survival, you no longer need to roll a new Survival check every hour when tracking, though you still need to roll whenever there are significant changes in the trail."),
(781,1,"261","Fascinating Performance","When you Perform, compare your result to the Will DC of one observer. If you succeed, the target is fascinated by you for 1 round. If the observer is in a situation that demands immediate attention, such as combat, you must critically succeed to fascinate it and the Perform action gains the incapacitation trait. You must choose which creature you’re trying to fascinate before you roll your check, and the target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour. If you’re an expert in Performance, you can fascinate up to four observers; if you’re a master, you can fascinate up to 10 observers; and if you’re legendary, you can fascinate any number of observers at the same time."),
(782,1,"261","Fast Recovery","Your body quickly bounces back from afflictions. You regain twice as many Hit Points from resting. Each time you succeed at a Fortitude save against an ongoing disease or poison, you reduce its stage by 2, or by 1 against a virulent disease or poison. Each critical success you achieve against an ongoing disease or poison reduces its stage by 3, or by 2 against a virulent disease or poison. In addition, you reduce the severity of your drained condition by 2 when you rest for a night instead of by 1."),
(783,1,"261","Feather Step","You step carefully and quickly. You can Step into difficult terrain."),
(784,1,"261","Fleet","You move more quickly on foot. Your Speed increases by 5 feet."),
(785,1,"261","Foil Senses","You are adept at foiling creatures’ special senses and cautious enough to safeguard against them at all times. Whenever you use the Avoid Notice, Hide, or Sneak actions, you are always considered to be taking precautions against special senses (see the Detecting with Other Senses sidebar on page 465)."),
(786,1,"261","Forager","While using Survival to Subsist, if you roll any result worse than a success, you get a success. On a success, you can provide subsistence living for yourself and four additional creatures, and on a critical success, you can take care of twice as many creatures as on a success."),
(787,1,"261","Glad-Hand","First impressions are your strong suit. When you meet someone in a casual or social situation, you can immediately attempt a Diplomacy check to Make an Impression on that creature rather than needing to converse for 1 minute. You take a –5 penalty to the check. If you fail or critically fail, you can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result."),
(788,1,"262","Group Coercion","When you Coerce, you can compare your Intimidation check result to the Will DCs of two targets instead of one. It’s possible to get a different degree of success for each target. The number of targets you can Coerce in a single action increases to four if you’re an expert, 10 if you’re a master, and 25 if you’re legendary."),
(789,1,"262","Group Impression","When you Make an Impression, you can compare your Diplomacy check result to the Will DCs of two targets instead of one. It’s possible to get a different degree of success for each target. The number of targets increases to four if you’re an expert, 10 if you’re a master, and 25 if you’re legendary."),
(790,1,"262","Hefty Hauler","You can carry more than your frame implies. Increase your maximum and encumbered Bulk limits by 2."),
(791,1,"262","Hobnobber","You are skilled at learning information through conversation. The Gather Information exploration activity takes you half as long as normal (typically reducing the time to 1 hour). If you’re a master in Diplomacy and you Gather Information at the normal speed, when you attempt to do so and roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead. There is still no guarantee that a rumor you learn with Gather Information is accurate."),
(792,1,"262","Impeccable Crafter","You craft flawless creations with great efficiency. Whenever you roll a success at a Crafting check to make an item of the type you chose with Specialty Crafting, you get a critical success instead."),
(793,1,"262","Impressive Performance","Your performances inspire admiration and win you fans. You can Make an Impression using Performance instead of Diplomacy."),
(794,1,"262","Incredible Initiative","You react more quickly than others can. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to initiative rolls."),
(795,1,"262","Incredible Investiture","You have an incredible ability to invest more magic items. Increase your limit on invested items from 10 to 12."),
(796,1,"262","Intimidating Glare","You can Demoralize with a mere glare. When you do, Demoralize loses the auditory trait and gains the visual trait, and you don’t take a penalty if the creature doesn’t understand your language."),
(797,1,"262","Intimidating Prowess","In situations where you can physically menace the target when you Coerce or Demoralize, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your Intimidation check and you ignore the penalty for not sharing a language. If your Strength score is 20 or higher and you are a master in Intimidation, this bonus increases to +2."),
(798,1,"262","Inventor","You are a genius at Crafting, easily able to determine how things are made and create new inventions. You can spend downtime to invent a common formula that you don’t know. This works just like the Craft activity: you spend half the Price of the formula up front, attempt a Crafting check, and on a success either finish the formula by paying the difference or work for longer to decrease the Price. The difference is that you spend the additional time in research, design, and development, rather than in creating an item. Once it’s complete, you add the new formula you invented to your formula book."),
(799,1,"262","Kip Up","You stand up. This movement doesn’t trigger reactions."),
(800,1,"262","Lasting Coercion","When you successfully Coerce someone, the maximum time they comply increases to a week, still determined by the GM. If you’re legendary, the maximum increases to a month."),
(801,1,"262","Legendary Codebreaker","Your skill with languages and codes is so great that you can decipher information with little more than a quick read through a text. You can Decipher Writing using Society while reading at normal speed. If you slow down and spend the full amount of time that’s ordinarily required and roll a success, you get a critical success; if you critically succeed while spending the normal amount of time, you gain a nearly word-for-word understanding of the document."),
(802,1,"263","Legendary Linguist","You’re so skilled with languages you can create a pidgin instantly. You can always talk to any creature that has a language—even a language you don’t know —by creating a new pidgin language that uses simplified terms and conveys basic concepts. To do so, you must first understand at least what medium of communication the creature uses (speech, sign language, and so on)."),
(803,1,"263","Legendary Medic","You’ve discovered medical breakthroughs or techniques that achieve miraculous results. Once per day for each target, you can spend 1 hour treating that target and attempt a Medicine check to remove a disease or the blinded, deafened, doomed, or drained condition. Use the DC of the disease or of the spell or effect that created the condition. If the effect’s source is an artifact, above 20th level, or similarly powerful, increase the DC by 10."),
(804,1,"263","Legendary Negotiation","You can negotiate incredibly quickly in adverse situations. You attempt to Make an Impression and then Request your opponent cease their current activity and engage in negotiations. You take a –5 penalty to your Diplomacy check. The GM sets the DC of the Request based on the circumstances—it’s generally at least a very hard DC of the creature’s level. Some creatures might simply refuse, and even those who agree to parley might ultimately find your arguments lacking and return to violence."),
(805,1,"263","Legendary Performer","Your fame has spread throughout the lands. NPCs who succeed at a DC 10 Society check to Recall Knowledge have heard of you and usually have an attitude toward you one step better than normal, depending on your reputation and the NPC’s disposition. For instance, if you’re well-known for cruel and demanding behavior, creatures might be intimidated by you, rather than be friendly toward you. When you Earn Income with Performance, you attract higher-level audiences than your location would allow, as audiences flock to see you. For instance, rulers and angels might travel to your small tower in the woods to hear you perform. Typically, this increases the audiences available by 2 levels or more, determined by the GM."),
(806,1,"263","Legendary Professional","Your fame has spread throughout the lands (for instance, if you have Warfare Lore, you might be a legendary general or tactician). This works as Legendary Performer, except you gain higher-level jobs when you Earn Income with Lore."),
(807,1,"263","Legendary Sneak","You’re always sneaking unless you choose to be seen, even when there’s nowhere to hide. You can Hide and Sneak even without cover or being concealed. When you employ an exploration tactic other than Avoiding Notice, you also gain the benefits of Avoiding Notice unless you choose not to. See page 479 for more information about exploration tactics."),
(808,1,"263","Legendary Survivalist","You can survive indefinitely without food or water and can endure severe, extreme, and incredible cold and heat without taking damage from doing so."),
(809,1,"263","Legendary Thief","Your ability to Steal defies belief. You can attempt to Steal something that is actively wielded or that would be extremely noticeable or time consuming to remove (like worn shoes or armor). You must do so slowly and carefully, spending at least 1 minute (and significantly longer for items that are normally time consuming to remove, like armor). Throughout this duration you must have some means of staying hidden, such as the cover of darkness or a bustling crowd. You take a –5 penalty to your Thievery check. Even if you succeed, if the item is extremely prominent—like a suit of full plate armor—onlookers will quickly notice it’s gone after you steal it."),
(810,1,"263","Lengthy Diversion","When you critically succeed to Create a Diversion, you continue to remain hidden after the end of your turn. This effect lasts for an amount of time that depends on the diversion and situation, as determined by the GM (minimum 1 additional round)."),
(812,1,"263","Magical Crafting","You can Craft magic items, though some have other requirements, as listed in Chapter 11. When you select this feat, you gain formulas for four common magic items of 2nd level or lower."),
(813,1,"264","Magical Shorthand","Learning spells comes easily to you. If you’re an expert in a tradition’s associated skill, you take 10 minutes per spell level to learn a spell of that tradition, rather than 1 hour per spell level. If you fail to learn the spell, you can try again after 1 week or after you gain a level, whichever comes first. If you’re a master in the tradition’s associated skill, learning a spell takes 5 minutes per spell level, and if you’re legendary, it takes 1 minute per spell level. You can use downtime to learn and inscribe new spells. This works as if you were using Earn Income with the tradition’s associated skill, but instead of gaining money, you choose a spell available to you to learn and gain a discount on learning it, learning it for free if your earned income equals or exceeds its cost."),
(814,1,"264","Multilingual","You easily pick up new languages. You learn two new languages, chosen from common languages, uncommon languages, and any others you have access to. You learn an additional language if you are or become a master in Society and again if you are or become legendary."),
(815,1,"264","Natural Medicine","You can apply natural cures to heal your allies. You can use Nature instead of Medicine to Treat Wounds. If you’re in the wilderness, you might have easier access to fresh ingredients, allowing you to gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check to Treat Wounds using Nature, subject to the GM’s determination."),
(816,1,"264","Nimble Crawl","You can Crawl incredibly swiftly—up to half your Speed, rather than 5 feet. If you’re a master in Acrobatics, you can Crawl at full Speed, and if you’re legendary, you aren’t flat-footed while prone."),
(817,1,"264","Oddity Identification","You have a sense for spells that twist minds or reveal secrets. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Occultism checks to Identify Magic with the mental, possession, prediction, or scrying traits."),
(818,1,"264","Pickpocket","You can Steal or Palm an Object that’s closely guarded, such as in a pocket, without taking the –5 penalty. You can’t steal objects that would be extremely noticeable or time consuming to remove (like worn shoes or armor or actively wielded objects). If you’re a master in Thievery, you can attempt to Steal from a creature in combat or otherwise on guard. When doing so, Stealing requires 2 manipulate actions instead of 1, and you take a –5 penalty."),
(819,1,"264","Planar Survival","You can Subsist using Survival on different planes, even those without resources or natural phenomena you normally need. For instance, you can forage for food even if the plane lacks food that could normally sustain you. A success on your check to Subsist can also reduce the damage dealt by the plane, at the GM’s discretion."),
(820,1,"264","Powerful Leap","When you Leap, you can jump 5 feet up with a vertical Leap, and you increase the distance you can jump horizontally by 5 feet."),
(821,1,"264","Quick Climber","When Climbing, you move 5 more feet on a success and 10 more feet on a critical success, to a maximum of your Speed. If you’re legendary in Athletics, you gain a climb Speed equal to your Speed."),
(822,1,"264","Quick Coercion","You can bully others with just a few choice implications. You can Coerce a creature after 1 round of conversation instead of 1 minute. You still can’t Coerce a creature in the midst of combat, or without engaging in a conversation."),
(823,1,"264","Quick Disguise","You can set up a disguise in half the usual time (generally 5 minutes). If you’re a master, it takes one-tenth the usual time (usually 1 minute). If you’re legendary, you can create a full disguise and Impersonate as a 3-action activity."),
(824,1,"264","Quick Identification","You can Identify Magic swiftly. You take only 1 minute when using Identify Magic to determine the properties of an item, ongoing effect, or location, rather than 10 minutes. If you’re a master, it takes a 3-action activity, and if you’re legendary, it takes 1 action."),
(825,1,"264","Quick Jump","You can use High Jump and Long Jump as a single action instead of 2 actions. If you do, you don’t perform the initial Stride (nor do you fail if you don’t Stride 10 feet)."),
(826,1,"265","Quick Recognition","You Recognize Spells swiftly. Once per round, you can Recognize a Spell using a skill in which you’re a master as a free action."),
(827,1,"265","Quick Repair","You take 1 minute to Repair an item. If you’re a master in Crafting, it takes 3 actions. If you’re legendary, it takes 1 action."),
(828,1,"265","Quick Squeeze","You Squeeze 5 feet per round (10 feet on a critical success). If you’re legendary in Acrobatics, you Squeeze at full Speed."),
(829,1,"265","Quick Swim","You Swim 5 feet farther on a success and 10 feet farther on a critical success, to a maximum of your Speed. If you’re legendary in Athletics, you gain a swim Speed equal to your Speed."),
(830,1,"265","Quick Unlock","You can Pick a Lock using 1 action instead of 2."),
(831,1,"265","Quiet Allies","You’re skilled at moving with a group. When you are Avoiding Notice and your allies Follow the Expert, you and those allies can roll a single Stealth check, using the lowest modifier, instead of rolling separately. This doesn’t apply for initiative rolls."),
(832,1,"265","Rapid Mantel","You easily pull yourself onto ledges. When you Grab an Edge, you can pull yourself onto that surface and stand. You can use Athletics instead of a Reflex save to Grab an Edge."),
(833,1,"265","Read Lips","You can read lips of others nearby who you can clearly see. When you’re at your leisure, you can do this automatically. In encounter mode or when attempting a more difficult feat of lipreading, you’re fascinated and flat-footed during each round in which you focus on lip movements, and you must succeed at a Society check (DC determined by the GM) to successfully read someone’s lips. In either case, the language read must be one that you know."),
(834,1,"265","Recognize Spell","If you are trained in the appropriate skill for the spell’s tradition and it’s a common spell of 2nd level or lower, you automatically identify it (you still roll to attempt to get a critical success, but can’t get a worse result than success). The highest level of spell you automatically identify increases to 4 if you’re an expert, 6 if you’re a master, and 10 if you’re legendary. The GM rolls a secret Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion check, whichever corresponds to the tradition of the spell being cast. If you’re not trained in the skill, you can’t get a result better than failure. Critical Success: You correctly recognize the spell and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your saving throw or your AC against it.  Success: You correctly recognize the spell. Failure: You fail to recognize the spell. Critical Failure: You misidentify the spell as another spell entirely, of the GM’s choice."),
(835,1,"266","Ride","When you Command an Animal you’re mounted on to take a move action (such as Stride), you automatically succeed instead of needing to attempt a check. Any animal you’re mounted on acts on your turn, like a minion. If you Mount an animal in the middle of an encounter, it skips its next turn and then acts on your next turn. Page 249 has more on Command an Animal."),
(836,1,"266","Robust Recovery","You learned folk medicine to help recover from diseases and poison, and using it diligently has made you especially resilient. When you Treat a Disease or a Poison, or someone else uses one of these actions on you, increase the circumstance bonus granted on a success to +4, and if the result of the patient’s saving throw is a success, the patient gets a critical success."),
(837,1,"266","Scare to Death","You can frighten foes so much, they might die. Attempt an Intimidation check against the Will DC of a living creature within 30 feet of you that you sense or observe and who can sense or observe you. If the target can’t hear you or doesn’t understand the language you are speaking, you take a –4 circumstance penalty. The creature is temporarily immune for 1 minute."),
(838,1,"266","Shameless Request","You can downplay the consequences or outrageousness of your requests using sheer brazenness and charm. When you Request something, you reduce any DC increases for making an outrageous request by 2, and if you roll a critical failure for your Request, you get a failure instead. While this means you can never cause your target to reduce their attitude toward you by making a Request, they eventually tire of requests, even though they still have a positive attitude toward you."),
(839,1,"266","Shield Block","You snap your shield in place to ward off a blow. Your shield prevents you from taking an amount of damage up to the shield’s Hardness. You and the shield each take any remaining damage, possibly breaking or destroying the shield."),
(840,1,"266","Sign Language","You learn the sign languages associated with the languages you know, allowing you to sign and understand signs. Sign languages typically require both hands to convey more complex concepts, and they are visual rather than auditory."),
(841,1,"266","Skill Training","You become trained in the skill of your choice."),
(842,1,"266","Slippery Secrets","You elude and evade attempts to uncover your true nature or intentions. When a spell or magical effect tries to read your mind, detect whether you are lying, or reveal your alignment, you can attempt a Deception check against the spell or effect’s DC. If you succeed, the effect reveals nothing."),
(843,1,"266","Snare Crafting","You can use the Craft activity to create snares, using the rules from page 244. When you select this feat, you add the formulas for four common snares to your formula book."),
(844,1,"266","Specialty Crafting","Your training focused on Crafting one particular kind of item. Select one of the specialties listed on page 267; you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Crafting checks to Craft items of that type. If you are a master in Crafting, this bonus increases to +2. If it’s unclear whether the specialty applies, the GM decides. Some specialties might apply only partially. For example, if you were making a morningstar and had specialty in woodworking, the GM might give you half your bonus because the item requires both blacksmithing and woodworking."),
(845,1,"267","Steady Balance","You can keep your balance easily, even in adverse conditions. Whenever you roll a success using the Balance action, you get a critical success instead. You’re not flat-footed while attempting to Balance on narrow surfaces and uneven ground. Thanks to your incredible balance, you can attempt an Acrobatics check instead of a Reflex save to Grab an Edge."),
(846,1,"267","Streetwise","You know about life on the streets and feel the pulse of your local settlement. You can use your Society modifier instead of your Diplomacy modifier to Gather Information. In any settlement you frequent regularly, you can use the Recall Knowledge action with Society to know the same sorts of information that you could discover with Diplomacy to Gather Information. The DC is usually significantly higher, but you know the information without spending time gathering it. If you fail to recall the information, you can still subsequently attempt to Gather Information normally."),
(847,1,"267","Student of the Canon","You’ve researched many faiths enough to recognize notions about them that are unlikely to be true. If you roll a critical failure at a Religion check to Decipher Writing of a religious nature or to Recall Knowledge about the tenets of faiths, you get a failure instead. When attempting to Recall Knowledge about the tenets of your own faith, if you roll a failure, you get a success instead, and if you roll a success, you get a critical success instead."),
(848,1,"267","Subtle Theft","When you successfully Steal something, observers (creatures other than the creature you stole from) take a –2 circumstance penalty to their Perception DCs to detect your theft. Additionally, if you first Create a Diversion using Deception, taking a single Palm an Object or Steal action doesn’t end your undetected condition."),
(849,1,"267","Survey Wildlife","You can study details in the wilderness to determine the presence of nearby creatures. You can spend 10 minutes assessing the area around you to find out what creatures are nearby, based on nests, scat, and marks on vegetation. Attempt a Survival check against a DC determined by the GM based on how obvious the signs are. On a success, you can attempt a Recall Knowledge check with a –2 penalty to learn more about the creatures just from these signs. If you’re a master in Survival, you don’t take the penalty."),
(850,1,"267","Swift Sneak","You can move your full Speed when you Sneak. You can use Swift Sneak while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type."),
(851,1,"267","Terrain Expertise","Your experience in navigating a certain type of terrain makes you supremely confident while doing so. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Survival checks in one of the following types of terrain, chosen when you select this feat: aquatic, arctic, desert, forest, mountain, plains, sky, swamp, or underground."),
(852,1,"267","Terrain Stalker","Select one type of difficult terrain from the following list: rubble, snow, or underbrush. While undetected by all non-allies in that type of terrain, you can Sneak without attempting a Stealth check as long as you move no more than 5 feet and do not move within 10 feet of an enemy at any point during your movement. This also allows you to automatically approach creatures to within 15 feet while Avoiding Notice during exploration as long as they aren’t actively Searching or on guard."),
(853,1,"268","Terrified Retreat","When you critically succeed at the Demoralize action, if the target’s level is lower than yours, the target is fleeing for 1 round."),
(854,1,"268","Titan Wrestler","You can attempt to Disarm, Grapple, Shove, or Trip creatures up to two sizes larger than you, or up to three sizes larger than you if you’re legendary in Athletics."),
(855,1,"268","Toughness","You can withstand more punishment than most before succumbing. Increase your maximum Hit Points by your level. You reduce the DC of recovery checks by 1 (page 459)."),
(856,1,"268","Train Animal","You spend time teaching an animal to do a certain action. You can either select a basic action the animal already knows how to do (typically those listed in the Command an Animal action on page 249) or attempt to teach the animal a new basic action. The GM determines the DC of any check required and the amount of time the training takes (usually at least a week). It’s usually impossible to teach an animal a trick that uses critical thinking. If you’re expert, master, or legendary in Nature, you might be able to train more unusual creatures, at the GM’s discretion. Success: The animal learns the action. If it was an action the animal already knew, you can Command the Animal to take that action without attempting a Nature check. If it was a new basic action, add that action to the actions the animal can take when Commanded, but you must still roll. Failure: The animal doesn’t learn the trick."),
(857,1,"268","Trick Magic Item","You examine a magic item you normally couldn’t use in an effort to fool it and activate it temporarily. For example, this might allow a fighter to cast a spell from a wand or allow a wizard to cast a spell that’s not on the arcane list using a scroll. You must know what activating the item does, or you can’t attempt to trick it."),
(859,1,"268","Unified Theory","You’ve started to make a meaningful connection about the common underpinnings of the four traditions of magic and magical essences, allowing you to understand them all through an arcane lens. Whenever you use an action or a skill feat that requires a Nature, Occultism, or Religion check, depending on the magic tradition, you can use Arcana instead. If you would normally take a penalty or have a higher DC for using Arcana on other magic (such as when using Identify Magic), you no longer do so."),
(860,1,"268","Unmistakable Lore","You never get information about your areas of expertise wrong. When you Recall Knowledge using any Lore subcategory in which you’re trained, if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead. If you’re a master in a Lore subcategory, on a critical success, you gain even more information or context than usual."),
(861,1,"268","Untrained Improvisation","You’ve learned how to handle situations when you’re out of your depth. Your proficiency bonus to untrained skill checks is equal to half your level instead of +0. If you’re 7th level or higher, the bonus increases to your full level instead. This doesn’t allow you to use the skill’s trained actions."),
(862,1,"268","Virtuosic Performer","You have exceptional talent with one type of performance. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus when making a certain type of performance. If you are a master in Performance, this bonus increases to +2. Select one of the following specialties and apply the bonus when attempting Performance checks of that type. If it’s unclear whether the specialty applies, the GM decides."),
(863,1,"269","Wall Jump","You can use your momentum from a jump to propel yourself off a wall. If you’re adjacent to a wall at the end of a jump (whether performing a High Jump, Long Jump, or Leap), you don’t fall as long as your next action is another jump. Furthermore, since your previous jump gives you momentum, you can use High Jump or Long Jump as a single action, but you don’t get to Stride as part of the activity."),
(864,1,"269","Ward Medic","You’ve studied in large medical wards, treating several patients at once and tending to all their needs. When you use Treat Disease or Treat Wounds, you can treat up to two targets. If you’re a master in Medicine, you can treat up to four targets, and if you’re legendary, you can treat up to eight targets."),
(865,1,"269","Wary Disarmament","If you trigger a device or set off a trap while disarming it, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your AC or saving throw against the device or trap. This applies only to attacks or effects triggered by your failed attempt, not to any later ones, such as additional attacks from a complex trap."),
(866,1,"269","Weapon Proficiency","You become trained in all simple weapons. If you were already trained in all simple weapons, you become trained in all martial weapons. If you were already trained in all martial weapons, you become trained in one advanced weapon of your choice."),
(867,TODO,"TODO","Relentless Stalker","Your hunted prey cannot escape your relentless pursuit. Stride up to your Speed in tandem with the triggering creature, remaining adjacent to the foe throughout its movement until it stops moving or you run out of movement. You can ignore difficult terrain during this movement unless the difficult terrain is caused by a magical effect."),
(868,TODO,"TODO","Wilderness Spotter","Select one type of terrain from the following list: aquatic, arctic, desert, forest, mountain, plains, sky, swamp, or underground.
