description: 'These mechanical constructs were created to serve as guardians in an
  ancient and bygone era, although exactly who made them and the secrets of their
  construction have long since been lost to history. From the waist up, they resemble
  humanoids made of metal, but from the waist down their bodies take the form of spinning
  metal tops ringed with blades, which excel at cutting down nearby foes. Most spiral
  centurions can be directed to stand down with a password, although often these command
  phrases have been lost to the mists of time. In rare cases, a spiral centurion may
  also wield manufactured weapons or a shield in addition to its built-in weapons,
  giving it access to additional actions besides those listed below.




  Most spiral centurions are hundreds or even thousands of years old, only staying
  functional because of the powerful magic used in their creation. Still, millennia
  of neglect have caused many spiral centurions to develop small glitches or malfunctions.

- it takes a -5 status penalty. A spiral centurion that has been knocked prone can-t
  use any actions other than to attempt to Stand
