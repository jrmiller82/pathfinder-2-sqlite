description: 'Among the rank-and-file soldiers of Heaven''s armies, few individuals
  are more dependable and truer to the cause than the noble hound archons, embodiments
  of the virtue of diligence. Unlike __horned archons__, who perform at a similar
  level along Heaven''s grand hierarchy, hound archons do not scout ahead for evil
  or perform reconnaissance missions in hostile territory. A hound archon''s role
  is as a soldier in the heart of battle or, occasionally, as a sentinel tasked with
  protecting a particular strategic location or holy site.
