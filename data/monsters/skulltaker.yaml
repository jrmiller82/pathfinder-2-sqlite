  description: The skulltaker causes splintered bones to erupt from all solid surfaces

    feet of movement. The first time each round a creature takes piercing damage from

    penalty to all Speeds for 10 minutes, or a –15-foot circumstance penalty for 24
    hours on a critical failure. The bones remain in place until the skulltaker uses
