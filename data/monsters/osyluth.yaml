description: 'An osyluth is an unparalleled inquisitor that revels in the sadism and
  torture for which __Hell__ is so well known. These devils'' charge is to seek out
  heresies, both among mortals and among other fiends—a commandment they uphold with
  unwavering fervor. They spawn within the Styx-fed swamps of Hell''s fifth layer,
  Stygia; where heresies and the souls of heretics stagnate, osyluths eventually rise.
  In the remote corners of that same layer of Hell, they build massive, calcified
  hives where they perform their vile interrogations and perfect their torturous arts
  upon lesser devils and petitioners alike.
