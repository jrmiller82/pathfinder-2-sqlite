description: 'Never have legend and misinformation met upon a more inauspicious brow
  than that of the lowly carbuncle. At first glance, carbuncles appear to be little
  more than ungainly reptiles. What sets them apart is their strange magical abilities
  and the gemstone-like horn protruding from between their goggling eyes. Although
  rumors suggest various uses for carbuncle horns, ranging from miracle cure-alls
  to potent magical components, the truth is much more mundane: a carbuncle''s horn
  is merely a highly reflective growth, not unlike a fingernail.
