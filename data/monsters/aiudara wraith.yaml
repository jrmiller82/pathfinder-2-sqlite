description: 'Dahak''s influence in Alseta''s Landing created a soul-draining effect
  that slays unprotected creatures within, transforming them into ghostly creatures
  known as aiudara wraiths, but these rare undead can rise within modern aiudara portals
  as well. Each time an individual travels through an aiudara, there''s a chance their
  passage could leave a faint imprint of their subconscious in the network. Normally
  this imprint simply fades away, but when an aiudara is damaged or the individual
  is suffering from necromantic contagions, these imprints can accumulate and, in
  time, coalesce on the Astral Plane or within Alseta''s Landing as a full-fledged
  aiudara wraith. The wraith is forced to live with an incomplete sense of self, always
  seeking its own memories and swiftly growing violent and vengeful as its quest to
  reclaim these ephemeral notions constantly meets with failure.
