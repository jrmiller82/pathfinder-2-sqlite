description: 'Jotund trolls are gigantic, nine-headed horrors who prowl frigid moors,
  marshes, and wastelands, always alone and always enraged. While each of the jotund
  troll''s nine heads possess their own brains and senses, they work much more in
  tandem than the dual-minded nature of the two-headed troll. Despite this, the heads
  often argue and bicker, particularly over which head gets to eat. The fact that
  all nine maws lead to the same shared stomach makes little difference in such culinary
  disagreements.




  Prevailing wisdom holds that the jotund troll represents a primordial, if not original,
  shape and design for the first trolls to plague the world, arising from a mythical
  realm in the Great Beyond known as Jotungard. This sprawling domain, said to be
  nestled in a remote reach of __Elysium__, is the legendary home of the deities of
  giant-kind. Whether the jotund troll was created in Jotungard to plague the Material
  Plane as punishment or challenge, or if it''s merely an evocative legend told by
  scholars, is unknown. In any case, the jotund trolls themselves likely care little.'
