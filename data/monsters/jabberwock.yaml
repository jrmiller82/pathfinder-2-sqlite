description: 'Few beasts have inspired as many legends, poems, songs, and myths in
  as many cultures, as this bizarre draconic creature. The jabberwock hails from the
  fey realm of the First World and is part of a group of powerful __First World__
  creatures known collectively as the Tane.




  Like all members of the Tane, jabberwocks are living creatures that age, eat, drink,
  and sleep, but do not reproduce normally. Instead, they are created directly by
  the godlike Eldest who rule the First World, and they serve at the pleasure (or
  frustration) of these capricious and mysterious entities. Believed to be the most
  powerful of all the Tane, jabberwocks are typically only ever created with one purpose:
  to wreak destruction and havoc upon the Material Plane. One of the Eldest might
  send a jabberwock to devastate a country, continent, or even entire world in order
  to get revenge for some slight made against them by a single mortal. Sometimes,
  no specific insult or injury is required, as some of the Eldest resent the very
  existence of the Material Plane and periodically create jabberwocks simply to express
  the wrath of the First World against its younger and less chaotic sibling.




  Once a jabberwock arrives on the Material Plane, its first order of business is
  to seek out a lair. It prefers dwelling in remote forest locations about a day''s
  flight from civilization—the more dangerous the woodland is to those who might eventually
  come hunting it, the better!




  The relationship between jabberwocks and __vorpal__ weapons is the subject of much
  debate and speculation among scholars, and the various poems, songs, and legends
  about the jabberwock do little to clarify the issue, conflicting and diverging on
  this point. Some believe that vorpal weapons were first created specifically to
  combat jabberwocks, but others take the story one step further. They cite evidence
  in certain ancient myths that there may once have been only a single, unique jabberwock,
  so powerful that nothing could so much as scratch it—nothing, that is, except for
  the first vorpal sword, crafted for that very purpose. So epic was the resulting
  battle that it created strange echoes throughout reality, and as a result, these
  echoes, in the form of vorpal weapons, can now be found on many worlds. Those who
  subscribe to this belief claim that the jabberwocks seen today are but pale imitations
  of this proto-jabberwock, and they speculate that only the combined efforts of several
  Eldest would be sufficient to create such a creature again.'
