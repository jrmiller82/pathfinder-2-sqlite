description: 'The babau is an assassin, a murderer, and a sadist—certainly not unusual
  traits, yet their penchant for stealth and surprise sets them apart from their kin.
  Babaus form from mortal souls of lone killers—those who took pleasure in more personal
  murders, and particularly those with grisly patterns to their killings.
