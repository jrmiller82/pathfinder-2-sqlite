description: "Choral angels are incredible singers who \x1Ffill the halls of Nirvana\
  \ with pious chants and sacred hymns. They form from the souls of talented bards\
  \ and other performers. While they shy away from conflict, they occasionally brave\
  \ the mortal realm to deliver good omens and auspicious messages. Choral angels\
  \ often serve the goddess Shelyn, but they can also serve other good deities and\
  \ empyreal lords.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Celestial__ (__Religion__)**: DC\
