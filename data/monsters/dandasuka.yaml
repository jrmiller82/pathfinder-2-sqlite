description: 'Known as “biters” among the more powerful rakshasa castes, dandasukas
  serve as spies and assassins for rakshasa clans or powerful spellcasters who have
  found methods to bind one of these fiends to their will. Born to manipulate and
  murder, these half-sized terrors revel in their work and delight in the sight of
  blood. They often dress in extravagant clothes dyed with ostentatious colors and
  wear numerous elaborate accessories, whether in their true form or in disguise as
  human children, halfling merchants, or anything else that helps them blend into
  their targeted society.




  A dandasuka rakshasa is constantly haunted by a monstrous hunger that gnaws at its
  hyperactive body, forcing it to feed often. In combat, a dandasuka might pause to
  lick a bloody blade or lap at a pool of spilled blood on the floor. These creatures
  settle for other meat when they must, but much prefer the taste of mortal humanoid
  flesh. Regular offers of such victuals can keep a dandasuka loyal to anyone willing
  to provide frequent meals, but care must be taken in keeping a dandasuka, for many
  stories tell of them being overly eager to serve an adored benefactor, taking off-hand
  remarks too literally, and performing services of violence that were never intended.
