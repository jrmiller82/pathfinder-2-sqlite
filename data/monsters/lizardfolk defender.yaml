description: 'The lizardfolk defender serves as a protector of the young, guardian
  of the settlement, and when no other options are available, soldier in time of war.
  They eagerly rise to the defense of their kin but do not revel in battle. An iruxi
  defender would rather turn back intruders and allow them to flee with the knowledge
  they were beaten, in hopes that such word prevents further invasions, but they are
  not naive. The iruxi understand the need for revenge, and when they allow a foe
  to escape, they do not forget.
