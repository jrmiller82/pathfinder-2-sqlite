  quasi-intelligent constructs dubbed siege shards. The shard's surface depicts the
  conflicts that created it, which hold the key to dispersing its psychic presence.
  A successful DC 18 check to __Recall Knowledge__ is sufficient to identify the conflict
  that engendered the construct. A creature aware of a shard's generative conflict
