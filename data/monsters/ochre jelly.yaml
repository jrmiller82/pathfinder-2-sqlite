description: 'Ochre jellies are animate masses of protoplasm with a sickly combination
  of yellow, orange, and brown hues. Their acidic bodies dissolve flesh but leave
  other materials, including a victim''s gear and bones, intact. Some ancient cultures
  would entomb bodies in stone sarcophaguses with ochre jellies to allow the ooze
  to break down the  flesh and clean and polish the bones.
