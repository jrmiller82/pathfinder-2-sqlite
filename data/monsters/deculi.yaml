  effect: 'The deculi creates an extradimensional space adjacent to itself in any
    10-foot-by-10-foot area of darkness and enters it. To non-deculis, the extradimensional
    space looks like an ordinary area of darkness (though effects such as __true seeing__
    can see through this illusion). The deculi''s infrared vision functions normally
    between this extradimensional space and the area outside its confines, allowing
    the deculi to sense what is going on around it, and its innate __darkness__ spell
    also extends to the area around the shadow sanctuary. Attacks cannot be made into
    or from the extradimensional space.


    The deculi can Dismiss this effect to emerge from its shadow sanctuary, but the
    space it emerges into must be in darkness and must be unobstructed. If the area
    is obstructed, the deculi is shunted to the nearest available space and takes
    1d6 bludgeoning damage per 5 feet shunted. If the area overlaying the shadow sanctuary
    becomes illuminated by magical light, the extradimensional space can no longer
    be accessed and the deculi is trapped within until the area is once again in darkness.
    The deculi can try to extinguish a magical light effect obscuring its sanctuary
    once per day by attempting to counteract the light effect with its __darkness__
    innate spell.


    If a deculi dies (including from hunger, thirst, or asphyxiation) while within
    the extradimensional space, the shadow sanctuary immediately ends and the deculi''s
    corpse is expelled. If the area is illuminated, the corpse is not expelled until
    the sanctuary entrance is in darkness once again.'

description: 'These batlike monstrosities inhabit the nooks and crevices of the Darklands,
  where they hang from stalactites and swoop down on unsuspecting prey. Though they
  are completely sightless, deculis possess rudimentary nerves in their skulls that
  allow them to detect the presence of infrared lightâ€”information they use to locate
  potential food and threats. They are deadly hunters, thanks largely to their magical
  ability to manipulate the ebb and flow of shadows. Deculis prefer to feed upon the
  warm blood of freshly killed prey, but they can subsist on carrion if they have
  to.
