description: 'Hideous necromantic rituals give rise to skavelings, or ghoul bats,
  monstrosities that are not true __ghouls__ but instead are specifically crafted
  undead creatures. Their creators are the bloodsucking __urdefhans__ of the Darklands,
  who create skavelings from __giant bats__ specially raised on diets of toxic fungus
  and the flesh of ghouls—especially brains harvested from these undead. Upon reaching
  maturity, these giant bats are ritually slain via the use of __cytillesh oil__.
  While this poison simply rots away the flesh of most creatures, one of these specially
  prepared bats will immediately rise from death as a skaveling after succumbing to
  its effects.




  Despite its tattered wings and sagging skin, a skaveling is more than capable of
  flight, even when carrying a creature mounted on its back—urdefhans often use skavelings
  as mounts in this way. Their intelligence is more advanced than that of the typical
  giant bat, and in combat they function more as allies than as mere mounts, capable
  of making their own tactical decisions. Yet even though they can reason and think,
  skavelings remain loyal to the urdefhans who created them, and they never take actions
  in a fight that would knowingly put their masters in harm''s way.
