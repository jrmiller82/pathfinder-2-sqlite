description: 'Sarglagons dwell in __Hell''s__ myriad waterways, lakes, and oceans.
  They serve as guardians of the Academy of Liesâ€”the repository of secrets in Stygia,
  the fifth layer of Hell. Sarglagons breathe water and air with equal ease, and can
  move through water, land, and even air with uncanny swiftness. Few fiends travel
  the waterways of the multiverse, but where a river crosses the planes, odds are
  sarglagons have traveled it to further their infernal machinations. The only body
  of water they avoid is the River Styx, as the fiends have yet to develop any defense
  against that waterway''s memory-sapping qualities. Mortal spellcasters sometimes
  bind sarglagons as guardians of precious secrets or treasures, particularly in aquatic
  areas. Most strangely, sarglagons sometimes act as unnerving caretakers to mortals
  who have no idea what they did to earn their unwanted protectors'' attention. The
  constant uninvited vigilance of these devils is often disturbing and stifling to
  their wards.
