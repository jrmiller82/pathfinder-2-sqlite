description: 'Xills visit the __Material Plane__, where they''re often known as ethereal
  stalkers, primarily to maraud and to kidnap creatures back to their native __Ethereal
  Plane__. These four-armed, warmongering monsters paralyze their victims before implanting
  them with eggs using an ovipositor normally kept retracted behind their mandibles.
  Their single-minded drive to expand and conquer is so all-encompassing that while
  they work together dutifully and without dissent, there is little else in their
  lives.
