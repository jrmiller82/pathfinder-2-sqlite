description: 'Because their genie forebears are native to the __Material Plane__,
  sulis (scions of mortals and __jann__) are by and large the most common geniekin
  on the Material Plane. They are often artisans and peace brokers, compelled to try
  and bring harmony and balance in a world wrought with discord.




  Sulis have a natural charm that often eludes other geniekin, but tend to layer on
  a level of boastful pride or even arrogance as a personal quirk or humorous facade.
  Few non-sulis realize that bragging is not simply the symptom of a puffed-up ego
  for sulis, but instead is a cultural institution easily comparable to human poetry.
  Sulis'' boasts not only glorify themselves, but also secure their companions'' and
  families'' accomplishments in history, with the ultimate goal of spinning stories
  that will be retold for generations. This is especially true for sulis who have
  lived with other geniekin and have been seen as lesser for not having a strong connection
  to an Elemental Plane.




  Suli dune dancers are but one way these geniekin seek to integrate with other humanoid
  societies. They work to hone their skills at boasting to an extent that their claims
  help to bolster those they travel with. Suli from regions other than deserts adjust
  their names to match their terrains, but regardless of whether they prefer forests,
  hills, or arctic plains, their boasts remain as compelling.
