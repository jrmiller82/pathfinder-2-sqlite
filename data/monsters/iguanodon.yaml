  description: The iguanodon makes a thumb spike Strike at an adjacent foe and then
    Strides up to 15 feet, dragging its thumb spike across the foe to gouge out a
    brutal wound. If this Strike hits, it deals an extra 1d8 points of slashing damage
    and the following Stride does not trigger reactions from the creature struck.
    This thumb spike Strike counts as two attacks when calculating the iguanodon's
    multiple attack penalty.

description: 'Iguanodons are large, herbivorous dinosaurs that inhabit swamps and
  forests where they browse on the abundant vegetation. The iguanodon is capable of
  moving on two feet or on four, quickly switching from one stance to the other depending
  on whether it needs to move through dense foliage or to reach delectable morsels
  hanging up in the canopy.




  Although iguanodons are herbivores, they are notoriously quick to anger. Their thumb
  spikes make their claws particularly devastating weapons. A well-placed blow from
  one of these claws can turn a hungry predator into a cowering beast with one swift
  strike. Iguanodons are 30 feet long and weigh 6,000 pounds.
