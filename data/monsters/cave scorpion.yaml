description: 'Cave scorpions prefer to reside in underground lairs. Most have lost
  nearly all of their pigmentation, making them appear ghostly when they lurk at the
  edge of the light. While they prefer to eat large insects, cave scorpions can and
  will attack humanoids. Some Darklands societies have developed techniques to herd
  or lure scorpions into pest-infested tunnels and warrens at the edge of their settlements,
  where the scorpions thrive in a dual role of exterminators and guardians.
