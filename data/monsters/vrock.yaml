  description: The vrock dances in flight and chants to create a ruinous explosion
    of electricity. If more vrocks within 30 feet want to join the dance, the vrock
    can delay the dance to wait for more vrocks; in that case, the effect occurs after
    the last vrock uses Dance of Ruin or one of the vrocks chooses to complete that
    round of the dance. Each non-demon creature in a 20-foot emanation from any of
    the dancing vrocks takes 2d12 electricity damage (DC 28 basic Reflex save). For
    each additional vrock that joins the dance, the damage increases by 1d12 and the
    save DC increases by 1 (to a maximum of four vrocks dealing 5d12 damage with a
    DC 31 save). The vrocks can continue dancing by using Dance of Ruin each round,
    for up to 3 rounds in total. The emanation's size increases by 20 feet each round,
    and the damage increases by 1d12 per vrock each round.

  description: The vrock emits a cloud of spores from their body, dealing 2d8 poison

description: 'When the gates to the Abyss swing wide, the first demons through are
  often vrocks, vulture-headed scions of rage who wheel through the air on black wings
  or dance with the exultation of their fiendish power. Their hatred for mortals is
  matched only by their desire to inflict suffering through their horrible screech
  or their devastating dance. Vrocks form from the souls of hateful mortals who are
  thus given another chance to inflict their rage on the world.




  Vrocks often travel in small groups so as to make the best use of their dance of
  ruin ability, but they rarely appear in groups larger than four. Against small groups
  and individuals, they swoop down without fear, hoping to play with their prey before
  going for the kill. Against formidable foes, they are just as happy to fly above,
  using their dance of ruin to cast a storm of lightning down on them.
