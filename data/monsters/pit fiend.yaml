description: 'When an army of devils invades to bathe a region in bloodshed and hellfire,
  it is likely that one of Hell''s most powerful and diabolical generals, the pit
  fiend, masterminded the incursion. Cunning, powerful, and ruthless, pit fiends often
  serve the archdevils directly. They rule infernal duchies, subjugate mortal worlds,
  and usurp infernal rivals using unparalleled despotism and calculated ferocity.
  To realize their tyrannical machinations, pit fiends claim mortal souls that they
  corrupt into lemure servants, which can then be shaped and transformed through infernal
  manipulation into the terrifying devils that form Hell''s formidable legions. They
  often select the most wicked and vicious lemures for their armies, drawing upon
  these lesser devils'' depravity during powerful magical ceremonies to create hideous
  and terrifying abominations that can cow and eviscerate the pit fiend''s enemies.




  Pit fiends themselves are crafted deep within the nightmarish bowels of Nessus,
  the ninth layer of Hell, to serve the whims of archdevils and infernal dukes. Those
  pit fiends that don''t leave Nessus to command infernal legions in the upper layers
  of Hell often form the courts of Hell''s elite, gathering cabals and sects that
  shape Hell''s political landscape through subterfuge and manipulation. But many
  pit fiends see themselves as living embodiments of hellfire, the all-encompassing
  wrath of Hell, and thus prefer to dwell in realms consumed by fire. In Avernus,
  Dis, Malebolge, Nessus, and Phlegethon, pit fiends build vast citadels of brimstone
  wreathed in flame to lord over.




  Pit fiends tower over other devils, standing at least 16 feet tall, weighing over
  1,000 pounds, and brandishing wingspans in excess of 20 feet.'
