description: 'Hyaenodons are the ferocious primeval cousins of the smaller hyena.
  Looming, shaggy-furred creatures nearly the size of a horse, hyaenodons are truly
  formidable predators to be reckoned with, due both to their size and to their bone-crushing
  jaws. Gnoll clans find these creatures particularly useful as mounts and guardians.
