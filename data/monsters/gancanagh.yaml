description: 'Gancanaghs are lovers, revelers, and dashing duelists of Elysium. Embodiments
  of free love, they eagerly throw themselves into courting targets for brief but
  earnest flings until their quicksilver passions change their desires. They serve
  Cayden Cailean as well as other bacchanalian deities and empyreal lords of Elysium
  who understand their desires for love and parties. Gancanaghs hate evil beings that
  profane the spirit of romance and passion, as such creatures (especially the demonic
  tempters known as succubi) reinforce stigmas against open and free love. One can
  give no greater insult to a gancanagh than to mistake him for such a creature, and
  more than one hotheaded gancanagh has challenged a misinformed paladin or other
  champion of good to a duel over such a slight. While they enjoy drinking and carousing,
  gancanaghs can''t stand smoke. Nonetheless, many gancanaghs carry whimsical-looking
  smoking pipes because they think it makes them look dapper. They cherish their silver
  flutes, for they enjoy the beauty of flutes'' music and its ability to sway the
  heart.




  The majority of gancanaghs present themselves as male, but the concept of gender
  to a creature like a gancanagh, which can change its shape freely, is much more
  fluid and open to interpretation than for many mortals. Gancanaghs enjoy using this
  flexibility to confront and test mortals'' convictions when faced with fear or prejudice,
  but when encountering mortals who themselves are open-minded about sexuality or
  gender identity, they can become lifelong allies. For those who are persecuted for
  such reasons, gancanaghs are tireless defenders and eager supporters, quick to provide
  safety and to punish those who would attempt to impose narrower beliefs upon a world
  that deserves more diversity than it often gets. If possible, a gancanagh seeks
  to educate and redeem those who hold destructive beliefs or prejudices, resorting
  to combat only to defend themself or an endangered mortal, or when no other option
  seems tenable—yet even then, they fight with sadness.
