description: 'Dalos are reclusive fey that dwell within or near remote volcanoes and
  volcanic vents and resemble the massive calderas they call home. They more often
  dwell within the superheated confines of these locales than in the “cold wastelands”
  beyond their warmth and are therefore rarely encountered outside such environments.
  Like most fey, dalos are capricious and vengeful. They hate being disturbed above
  all else and will often warn away intruders with only the throw of a red-hot boulder
  before attacking outright.




  A dalos stands 25 feet tall and weighs in excess of 20,000 pounds.
