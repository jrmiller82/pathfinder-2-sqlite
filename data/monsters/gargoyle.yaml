description: 'Gargoyles are monstrous hunters made of elemental stone. They use their
  resemblance to decorative statues to hide in plain sight in cities during the day
  and descend upon unlucky pedestrians at night. Their most common form is that of
  a horned humanoid with bat-like wings, but individual gargoyles show a great deal
  of variation, with some appearing more or less humanoid and others resembling no
  known creature. A gargoyle''s features are not flxed; city-dwelling gargoyles who
  remain in the same locale long enough slowly morph, day by day, to match the style
  of the local architecture. These patient monsters can stay disguised for long stretches
  of time as they patiently await an opportunity to strike.




  Gargoyles tend to be lone hunters, though sometimes they band into fearsome tribes
  called “wings” for protection or sport. On rare occasions, wings become relatively
  stable communities, and gargoyles in wings may even ally with other creatures such
  as demons and intelligent aberrations, though these alliances exist on a razor''s
  edge. The majority of gargoyles are treacherous, vindictive, and petty—traits that
  preclude lasting partnerships. Many tend to be obsessive and compulsive. Some are
  collectors, focusing on anything from books to grim trophies, while others are ritualistic
  or overly passionate about niche intellectual subjects or certain artistic motifs.
  These tendencies often contribute to the dissolution of wings as individuals'' obsessions
  and compulsions clash.'
