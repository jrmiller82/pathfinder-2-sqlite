description: 'Magma dragons have a reputation among other dragons for being unpredictable
  and brash. Their temperament and tendency for violent outbursts ensure that the
  typical magma dragon lives a solitary life, with hatchlings often bickering or fighting
  to establish dominance among themselves before they leave the nest. A magma dragon
  always has a reason for their outbursts and can always justify their sudden turns
  in mood, yet they rarely feel the need to do so.




  Magma dragons build lairs within volcanically active mountains or deep underground
  amid vast lakes of bubbling magma. As with all true dragons, magma dragons keep
  hoards of treasure, but the nature of their searing lairs limits the type of valuables
  they collect to metals, gems, and items capable of resisting the heat of a volcano''s
  core.
