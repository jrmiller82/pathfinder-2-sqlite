description: 'Animated statues are often used to guard crypts, small shrines, or areas
  in government buildings where they can be positioned amid normal statues to hide
  their true nature until an intruder arouses their ire. Adventurers'' suspicions
  regarding statues suddenly animating and attacking has led many less scrupulous
  adventurers to automatically attack any statues they encounter, ruining harmless,
  ancient relics.
