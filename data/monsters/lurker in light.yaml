description: 'These malicious and strange fey appear as fairies about 2 feet tall,
  with insectile wings, large eyes, and bulbous heads. They slaughter and cause mischief
  in a pattern only their alien intellect understands, but they''ve been seen to take
  particular umbrage against dwarves, gnomes, and creatures who live in darkness.
  With their grudges and pursuit of their own wicked and sadistic whims, lurkers in
  light deftly overturn the conventional wisdom that creatures associated with light
  are benign and friendly.




  While lurkers in light are fey and have ties to the __First World__, these creatures
  are often found elsewhere in the Great Beyond. They are particularly fond of invading
  the __Shadow Plane__ to bring light to those who dwell there-not to help, but to
  spread misery and pain among those to whom light is agonizing.
