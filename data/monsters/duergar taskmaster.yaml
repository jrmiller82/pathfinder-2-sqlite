description: 'Duergar priests of the taskmaster god Droskar often assume leadership
  roles within their communities, advancing the goals of their deity through coercion
  and displays of force. Often referred to as duergar taskmasters, these leaders often
  issue commands to duergar subordinates and slaves in the same breath, treating the
  two almost as if they were interchangeable. As a result, duergar taskmasters are
  loathed by both slave and slaver alike.
