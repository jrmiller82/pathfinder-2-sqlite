description: 'For many, gambling is just fun and games, but for some, it can become
  a bad habit or even a life-consuming addiction. Bone croupiers take the meaning
  of “life-consuming” to its literal extreme. Undead gamblers whose lust for cards
  and dice couldn''t be sated in life, they haunt the shadowy corners of gambling
  halls and continue their search for that next hit of adrenaline.




  In undeath, gaming takes on a different flavor; with nothing left to lose, bone
  croupiers turn their attentions toward others, cajoling and palavering normally
  casual gamers into committing themselves to ever higher stakes. Before they know
  it, these unsuspecting victims have called in decades-old favors and put liens on
  their homes in the hope of winning back just a fraction of the pot. But by then
  the bone croupier has already claimed its prize—for to this undead chiseler, any
  earnings are incidental, and the real prize is encouraging others to lose their
  own.




  Bone croupiers often enshroud themselves in thick layers of cigar smoke or voluminous
  robes to mask their undead nature, but they almost always wear wicked grins at the
  table. This smile is no ruse or part of its poker face, however—the truth is that
  bone croupiers truly delight in games, regardless of whether they are winning or
  losing, and despite their incredible skills of deception and trickery, most simply
  can''t disguise their unbridled mirth.
