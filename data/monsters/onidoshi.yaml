description: 'Onidoshi, or ogre mages, are oni with the material form of an __ogre__.
  Onidoshi''s supernatural prowess and overwhelming intellect are enough to awe and
  cow entire families of rank-and-file ogres. Because of this, onidoshi are often
  found at the head of ogre war parties or orchestrating these violent campaigns from
  behind the scenes. It''s rare for onidoshi to lead solitary existences, but those
  who do prefer to maraud the countryside or exploit villages and hoard the spoils
  for themselves.
