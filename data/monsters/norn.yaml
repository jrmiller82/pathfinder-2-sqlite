description: 'Ancient beyond imagining, norns are powerful fey women who hold in their
  hands the physical manifestation of fate and destiny in the form of golden thread.
  They watch over all life, intervening with reluctance when called uponâ€”or with a
  vengeance when the strands of fate are twisted and abused by lesser beings.




  Norns'' relationship with the Eldest of the First World is complex. Many among norns
  serve __Magdh__ the Three, the triune Eldest who some norns believe to be the first
  norn triumvirate bound together into one entity, as Magdh has three bodies: a Maiden,
  a Mother, and a Matriarch. Magdh claims to be watching the threads of fate for some
  ominous prophesied cataclysm, and in addition to assisting in her divinations, Magdh
  expects the norns who serve her to follow her cryptic commands to help nudge the
  future away from the brink. However, norns are powerful beings in their own right,
  themselves capable of granting divine power, and many balk at serving the enigmatic
  demigod. These norns find the other Eldest even more alien and challenging to interact
  with, for they believe that while the Eldest wield great power, even these powerful
  beings should not be granted leave to meddle with fate as much as they desire.




  While even the weakest of the Eldest could destroy an unaffiliated norn with ease,
  they tend to obey the proclamations and judgments of norns when they are spoken.
  These norns, for their part, use their perceived neutrality judiciously. They know
  better than to issue too many demands to the Eldest, lest the capricious demigods
  grow frustrated and tired of norns'' interference. And so the balance of power remains
  tenuous between unaffiliated norns and the Eldest, as it has for eons. However,
  norns know that it''s merely a matter of time before the Eldest lose their respect
  for this tradition and start acting entirely as they please, despite norns'' best
  efforts to rein in their most disruptive actions.




  A norn stands 14 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds.'
