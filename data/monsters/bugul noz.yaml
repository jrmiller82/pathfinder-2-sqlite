description: 'This gangly fey humanoid wanders the overgrown paths of dark, misty
  forests, voluntarily isolating themself in an attempt to protect others from their
  hideous form. A bugul noz''s appearance is not merely unsightly—to view the being''s
  form is said to tempt death, and backwoods villagers tell tales of wanderers found
  struck dead after merely glancing at the creature. As they jaunt through the forest,
  the bugul noz sings an eerie tune to alert others to their presence and deter these
  creatures from looking upon them. The bugul noz does not, after all, want to harm
  anyone; they are inherently kind, if unpredictable, and if they accidentally kill
  a creature out of panic or confusion, they grieve. A bugul noz who roams the same
  road long enough compiles a long list of such accidental victims, and they might
  carry the corpses off to a single mass grave deep in the forest. When not wandering,
  the bugul noz watches over this grave to ensure that the spirits of their victims
  are never lonely.
