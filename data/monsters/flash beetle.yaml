description: 'These 3-foot-long insects boast a pair of glowing organs on the back
  of the abdomen that give off bright light and that continue to glow for days, even
  after the creature''s death. Flash beetles are commonly herded and harvested by
  miners and spelunkers, as their glow is considered safer than torches and less expensive
  than lamps. Denizens of the Darklands often domesticate and train these insects,
  using them as pets, livestock, or caging them to use as organic sources of light
  in areas frequented by visitors unaccustomed to the darkness.
