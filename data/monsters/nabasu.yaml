description: 'Nabasus are birthed directly into the Material Plane from the __Abyss__,
  an invasive infestation that releases the newly formed and ravenously hungry demons
  directly into the midst of their favored prey: mortal life. Nabasus feed on sapient
  creatures, but they never quite manage to sate their eternal hunger, even as they
  grow more and more powerful. Once they have sufficiently feasted, the demons become
  worthy to make the return trip to the Abyss, where they undergo a vile transformation,
  finally digesting their accumulated meals and deforming further into powerful __vrolikais__.




  Nabasus form from the souls of evil gluttons, particularly from cannibals, blood-drinkers,
  and those who prefer the tang of undead flesh.
