description: 'While cockroaches tend to gather in cramped spaces, a disturbed colony
  is sometimes prone to swarming, where hundreds or even thousands of the insects
  scurry out of their hiding places in a raft of shiny brown and black carapaces on
  thousands of skittering legs. Given how disgusting many find cockroaches to be,
  encountering such a swarm can be alarming to even the most seasoned adventurers.
  The creatures are relentless when disturbed; in contrast to the insects'' normally
  skittish and harmless nature, as swarms they pursue the creature or creatures that
  provoked them and harry them with thousands of stinging bites.
