description: 'Xotanispawn are monstrous versions of scavenging beetle larvae that
  have been corrupted and mutated by feeding on the remains of Xotani the Firebleeder,
  a slain Spawn of Rovagug buried beneath Pale Mountain in Katapesh. These creatures
  look vaguely like the minute insects they once were, with a sclerotized head and
  chitinous body plates, six legs, and numerous dorsal spines lining the joints and
  edges of each segment. However, by feeding on the unholy remains of Xotani, the
  spawn have manifested many of the traits of the infamous Firebleeder, most notably
  a blisteringly hot internal temperature and powerful fire attacksâ€”to say nothing
  of their monstrous size.




  Internal heat radiates from every surface of a Xotanispawn, even from its mouth.
  Any contact with a Xotanispawn results in burns and the risk of catching on fire.
  Thankfully, Xotanispawn have also inherited Xotani''s weaknesses to cold and sunlight.
  They are rarely encountered on the surface during the day, opting to emerge from
  their subterranean lairs only at night.
