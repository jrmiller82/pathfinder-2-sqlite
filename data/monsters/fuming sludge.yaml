description: 'The slurry from alchemical experiments is often as flammable as it is
  toxic. In especially volatile cases, a fuming sludge can form from ignited pools
  of unstable alchemical runoff. It resembles a charcoal-colored slurry studded with
  tiny embers, and it continually emits a thin haze of accelerant that amplifies the
  fires it starts.




  A fuming sludge must consume the base chemicals of living creatures to survive and
  can instinctively identify the complex molecules found in most animate creatures.
  The first meal of many a fuming sludge is its accidental creator, but it soon moves
  on to hunt in lush forests or densely populated settlements. A fuming sludge can
  extrude a powerful pseudopod to strike its victims, but it can also eject portions
  of its body with peristaltic contractions. These rapidly-cooling globs of goo slow
  down fleeing prey, but the cold, crusty residue can also alert canny explorers to
  their presence.
