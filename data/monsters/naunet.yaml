description: 'Pugnacious and powerfully muscled, naunets serve as scouts and rank-and-file
  troops of protean armies. Resembling a thick salamander with a wide head, a powerful
  tail, and tentacles tipped with snapping jaws in place of rear legs, naunets are
  the most bestial of the proteans and occupy one of their lowest castes. Naunets
  are 12 feet long and weigh 900 pounds.




  All proteans are prone to unpredictable fits and unexpected action, but compared
  to most others, naunets are much more bestial. Always ready for a fight, naunets
  pride themselves in acting swiftly and striking before unpleasant distractions like
  diplomacy can blunt a combat''s beginning.
