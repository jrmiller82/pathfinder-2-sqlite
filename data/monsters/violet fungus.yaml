description: 'At a glance, a violet fungus might seem to be little more than an unsightly
  and sickeningly purple mushroom of unusual size. Only once one draws closer— once
  whip-like tentacles dripping with flesh-rotting venom slither out from the fungus''s
  cratered cap—does the terrifying truth of this carnivorous toadstool become apparent.
  Many amateur spelunkers have met untimely ends in the clutches of this monstrous
  fungus''s tentacles, since violet fungi are practically synonymous with caverns
  on Golarion.




  Anyone who has ever braved the world''s caves for an extended period of time know
  the dangers of the deadly violet fungus. Darklands dwellers such as drow and duergars
  often bear the long, whip-like scars of at least one brush with this vicious plant''s
  cruel, poison-infused tentacles. Canny subterranean trappers and scouts sometimes
  make use of cultivated violent fungi to catch game in the enormous caverns below
  the surface world. Some Darklands peoples also cultivate violet fungi as a means
  to defend their territory. __Xulgaths__ in particular place violet fungi around
  the perimeters of their settlements as a first line of defense.
