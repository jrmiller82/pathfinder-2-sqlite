description: 'This large and powerful omnivore inhabits forested hills. While it typically
  sustains itself on nuts, berries, fish, and small mammals, it''s fiercely territorial
  and will chase off or kill any creature it views as competition. Grizzly bears are
  especially temperamental when their young are nearby. In combat, a grizzly bear
  often attempts to grab and maul its foe with surprising ferocity. It continues its
  assault until its foe seems like it is no longer a threat, though if the bear is
  hungry, it will not hesitate to feed.
