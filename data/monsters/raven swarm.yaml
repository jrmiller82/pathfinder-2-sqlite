  description: There are few things as dangerously persistent in the natural world
    as an angry unkindness of ravens. A raven swarm can hound its prey through most
    barriers. Simple latches, unsecured chimney flues, loosely shuttered windows,

    __Thievery__ check to bypass many of these simple obstructions, typically against

description: 'A flock of ravens is known as an unkindness. Certainly the name lives
  up to its meaning when a swarm of ravens decides to work together. In most cases,
  a raven swarm like the one presented here won''t attack larger foes, but when manipulated
  by supernatural forces or simple desperation born from hunger, an unkindness of
  ravens can be a surprisingly dangerous foe.
