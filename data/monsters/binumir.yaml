description: 'Whenever two individuals who share a strong emotional bond perish together,
  they might rise as a combined spirit known as a binumir. The two individuals'' souls
  partially merge into a singular entity, though each one feels a constant longing
  for the other. This curse causes a binumir great distress and envy, leading the
  creature to lash out and attack others. Only the destruction of the binumir will
  liberate the two spirits and finally give them peace.




  Binumirs commonly appear in places where people die sharing their last moments together,
  such as in settlements hit by natural disasters. The two spirits of a binumir are
  distinct. Each half retains the visage of the respective individual that died to
  later form part of the creature. The spirits typically appear holding hands, but
  they constantly search for each other. They cry and weep for their lost loved one,
  unable to recognize the other''s presence right beside them.
