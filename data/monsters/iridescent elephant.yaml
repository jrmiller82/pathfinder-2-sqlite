description: 'An iridescent animal is a wild or domesticated animal that has undergone
  a magical transformation to become a luminescent beast that can glow in the dark
  and use dazzling light-based powers. Although the effect is glamorous, the life
  of an iridescent animal is a sad one. The change drastically weakens the animal,
  diminishing both its strength and its vitality. This effect is desirable for some—particularly
  the circuses, menageries, and royal courts that typically purchase these glowing
  beasts—but never for the animal itself. Because the effects of the transformation
  are so deleterious, the act of creating an iridescent animal is strongly frowned
  upon by druids and other naturalists, some of whom dedicate their lives to rescuing
  and fostering these maltreated creatures. The procedure cannot be reversed, and
  few iridescent animals are fit to live in the wild after the transformation, cementing
  their lot in life to serve as showy beasts of burden or objects of entertainment
  and ridicule.
