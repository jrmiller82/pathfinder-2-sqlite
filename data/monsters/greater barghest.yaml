description: 'Once a barghest has eaten enough to grow into a greater barghest, it
  typically seeks a method to leave the Material Plane and return to the Abyss, there
  joining other fiends as yet another of that plane''s horrors. As barghests have
  no innate ability to travel the planes, though, the time it takes for most greater
  barghests to engineer such a return can usually be measured in years, if not decades.
  During that time, greater barghests continue to play the roles of gluttons, hunters
  of humanity, and tyrants of goblinoid tribes. More than a few grow accustomed to
  such lives on the Material Plane and wholly abandon the end goal of returning to
  the Abyss, despite the fact that those who do make such a return home often grow
  even more powerful over time, gaining eerie new abilities and qualities absorbed
  from the raw chaos of the Abyss itself.




  In addition to greater barghests being more powerful than typical barghests, the
  process of transforming into a greater barghest results in hideous mutations that
  often grant deadly abilities. Some barghests grow large bat-like wings upon their
  transformation. Others develop toxic breath or vestigial limbs. The options detailed
  in the stats below represent only the tip of the proverbial iceberg for barghest
  mutationsâ€”feel free to use these as inspiration for coming up with new mutations
  of your own design.
