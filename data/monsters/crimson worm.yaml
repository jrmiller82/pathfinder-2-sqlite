description: 'Among the most dangerous cave worms are the fiery crimson worms. In
  addition to being even larger than azure or purple worms, the crimson worm has a
  penchant for burrowing through volcanic regions that, over the generations, have
  infused it with a supernatural link to the Elemental Plane of Fire. The molten heart
  of an active volcano is an attractive lair for a crimson worm, as are the sprawling
  fields of bubbling magma found in the deepest reaches of the Darklands. Legends
  from ancient peoples, precursor dwarven societies, and colonists of the Elemental
  Planes populated moats of lava with crimson worms likely have some basis in truth,
  although the methods such ancients used to keep these “moat worms” contained and
  prevented them from chewing their way through fortress foundations must have been
  significant.




  Crimson worms sometimes frequent areas on the surface where volcanism creates hot
  springs or other geothermal features, but even then they prefer to spend most of
  their time burrowing through the ground in their never-ending search for sustenance.
  Surface lands claimed by crimson worms are notable for the mound-shaped burrows
  these creatures leave behind as they dig.
