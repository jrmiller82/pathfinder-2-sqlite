description: 'Two-headed trolls are savage, dual-minded monsters with an unquenchable
  thirst for bloodshed, and dread tales of their ravenous appetites are whispered
  of in homesteads throughout the lands of the Inner Sea. Indeed, it is a custom for
  parents to invoke the two-headed troll as a warning to misbehaving children. “Finish
  your chores,” a parent might say to a stubborn child, “or a two-headed troll will
  snatch you away at night and swallow you whole!” It''s unclear why such a morbid
  tradition gained traction with parents, but it''s an undeniable fact that two-headed
  trolls have an appetite for “nibbles”—creatures small enough to devour with one
  bite.




  Mature two-headed trolls stand 13 feet in height, weighing roughly 1,700 pounds.
  Unlike common trolls, two-headed trolls share the upright gait of their __ettin__
  ancestry and do not walk hunched over.'
