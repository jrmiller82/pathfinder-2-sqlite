description: 'While the other primal dragons hail from the Elemental Planes, the cruel
  and unceasingly malicious umbral dragons originate in the depths of the Shadow Plane.
  Their sleek black scales and serpentine grace allow them to strike from hiding,
  and they are known for playing with their prey before finally finishing it. These
  creatures of shadowy energy and unwholesome appetites prefer the necrotic flesh
  of undead creatures to any other meal. This strange hunger can be of accidental
  benefit to nearby humanoid societies, but ultimately they hunt and kill undead creatures
  for the taste, rather than out of any desire to protect others from the undead.
  The benefit is always short-lived, however. When umbral dragons exhaust their preferred
  prey, they turn on whatever living creatures happen to be nearby. Umbral dragons
  sometimes go to great lengths to obtain their favorite meals, even creating undead
  creatures that they then feast upon.




  For all their power, umbral dragons are uninterested in fair battles. When faced
  with foes that pose any kind of actual danger to them, umbral dragons flee into
  the shadows and seek to strike back through pawns or minions rather than risk their
  own lives. Their treasure hoards are varied and diverse, often augmented by loot
  stolen from crypts the dragons have turned into feeding grounds. They have a strong
  respect for and interest in traditions and heirlooms, and they often seek to augment
  their hoards with items of great value that have been handed down through the generations
  of those whose corpses and ghosts they''ve fed upon.
