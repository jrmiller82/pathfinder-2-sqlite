description: 'Wargs hunt in packs and surround their prey like common wolves, but
  their cunning and penchant for taunting victims makes them easy to distinguish from
  their less-intelligent cousins. But despite their intelligence, wargs have simple
  desires for food and shelter, making them easy for evil humanoids such as orcs and
  hobgoblins to recruit to protect their camps or join them in battle. Most wargs
  are amenable to this arrangement, but if food should run out, wargs are more than
  willing to integrate goblinoid flesh into their diet.
