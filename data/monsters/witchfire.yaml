description: 'Manifesting as a sinuous form wreathed in sickly green flames, this
  incorporeal undead forms when a powerful __hag__ or __witch__ dies in agony or rage.
  The body at the center of the flames usually resembles the witch''s idealized self-image,
  regardless of their age and appearance at the time of their death.




  A witchfire often resides in a bog or swamp, which slowly blackens and decays around
  them. These regions are often plagued by __will-o''-wisps__, which seem to have
  an uncanny relationship with the resident witchfire. A witchfire might visit villages
  on the edge of their home terrain to lure away villagers, but always attack victims
  within earshot to make sure that other villagers hear the screams. A witchfire might
  also ally with other hags or witches and even join their covens, but a witchfire
  is incapable of forming covens entirely on their own.
