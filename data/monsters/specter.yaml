description: 'When an evil mortal creature dies, it sometimes returns to haunt the
  area of its death as a specter, a hateful remnant, always seeking to slay others—particularly
  __humanoids__—in an attempt to distribute its pain among as many souls as it can.
  A specter maintains a strange semblance of its prior identity, but with a corrupted
  sense of purpose. It cannot be reasoned with.




  A specter denied the opportunity to harm living humanoids grows increasingly agonized
  and irrational, akin to the mindset of a starving person forever denied a release
  from agony through death.
