  description: A creature grabbed by a vine lasher is not immobilized, but the grabbed
    creature's space and every adjacent square use the rules for difficult terrain.
    If the creature moves, the vine lasher moves with it, always keeping the grabbed
    creature within 10 feet of itself. If two or more vine lashers have a creature
    grabbed in this way, then the target's space and adjacent square instead use the
    rules for greater difficult terrain.
