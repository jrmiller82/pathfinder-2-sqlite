description: 'Barbazus, known also as bearded devils or infantry devils, are murderous
  fiends who satiate their lust for annihilation by serving as the foot soldiers of
  Hell''s armies, often leading hordes of lesser devils such as imps and lemures into
  battle. Bearded devils wield serrated glaives to inflict jagged gashes that resist
  healing magic, resulting in tremendous blood loss. When enemies come too close,
  bearded devils strike with the spines of their wriggling beards to deliver a wretched
  contagion called Avernal fever, savoring the sight of their victim''s strength being
  slowly devoured from within.




  Barbazus can be found savagely indulging the whims of evil infernal lords from all
  layers of Hell, rejoicing as they disseminate murder, misery, and anguish as they
  see fit.
