description: 'The ruling caste of the proteans, keketars orchestrate attacks against
  the bastions of law and adjudicate protean disputes confidently and capriciously.
  A keketar resembles a shimmering, serpentine creature with spines, claws, and a
  dragon-like head. A keketar''s actual appearance is in constant flux, but they generally
  stay about 18 feet long with a weight of around 1,500 pounds. While their physical
  forms can vary, two things remain constant: First, a keketar''s eyes are always
  a piercing shade of amber or violet. Second, the keketar''s mark of office—a crown
  of shifting symbols that hovers above its head—never changes. A keketar cannot remove
  its crown but can suppress it, although most are loath to do so and consider such
  an act one of cowardice or shame.




  Keketars fill a role in protean society of a sort of priesthood, operating as intermediaries
  between the other proteans and the Speakers of the Depths. All other proteans defer
  to keketars, treating them in a way similar to how citizens of a mortal city would
  treat respected nobles; even more powerful proteans defer to the will of the keketars.
  As with many religions, dogma and theology are prone to interpretation and change,
  and among the proteans the situation is perhaps even more pronounced. Whatever the
  nature of and desires held by the mysterious Speakers of the Depths, individual
  keketars may come to dramatically different conclusions as to their will and intent.
  To the proteans, though, this inherent dissonance is a strength rather than a weakness.
