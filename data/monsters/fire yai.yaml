description: 'Fire yai take the form of __fire giants__. Like fire giants, fire yai
  are shrewd and militaristic and have an incredible appetite for the thrill of war.
  While they engage in battle to conquer and control others, fire yai also love the
  thrill of war, fighting for the sheer joy of it. Presenting a fire yai with a true
  challenge in combat can potentially earn their mercy and an offer to join and serve
  at their side. Fire yai''s third eyes shoot forth burning missiles of fire.
