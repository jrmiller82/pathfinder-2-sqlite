description: 'Derghodaemons represent death through unfathomable violence and being
  eaten alive. Whether in life a ravenous murderer hacked them to bits for stew, a
  werewolf tore them limb from limb, or they simply succumbed to the elements and
  became worm meat, derghodaemons seek to inflict the same twisted and bloody ends
  upon any they come across. Unlike some daemons, derghodaemons derive little pleasure
  from prolonged deaths—to these fiends, the quicker they can enact a gory demise,
  the sooner they can turn their attentions to their next victim and repeat the violent
  cycle.




  Derghodaemons look like walking masses of razor-sharp insect claws connected to
  equally menacing chitinous limbs, but few linger on their appearance for long— the
  gaze of a derghodaemon is enough to cause others in the vicinity to experience severe
  visual warping. The derghodaemon''s appearance becomes more and more twisted as
  those who stare at it experience vicious hallucinations and ravenous urges to inflict
  harm on and devour others. Perhaps the most horrific attack derghodaemons can unleash
  upon their victims, though, is their swarming infestation—the daemons cough up a
  crawling, buzzing cloud of ravenous insects that cling to those targeted and chew
  them to death, provided the mind-numbing, half-whispered threats made by the rasp
  of the insects'' bodies don''t drive them to violent fury first!
