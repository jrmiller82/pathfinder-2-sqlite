description: 'Riding dogs types include larger dogs, such as mastiffs, wolfhounds,
  and huskies, and are bred often by halflings and gnomes to serve as mounts. Riding
  dogs are as loyal and devoted to their masters as guard dogs, and are ferocious
  in battle, regardless of whether they bear a rider or not. As with guard dogs, these
  large hounds can be wild or feral in nature, and, in some cases, might rival packs
  of wolves with regard to the danger they pose to inhabitants of rural areas.
