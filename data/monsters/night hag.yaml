description: 'Night hags are thieves and merchants of mortal souls. These foul creatures
  collect souls in dark gems or crystalline jars to sell in fiendish markets, and
  are themselves empowered by potent magic jewels known as heartstones. They haunt
  the Ethereal Plane, where they prey upon mortals in their dreams, debilitating them
  with horrific nightmares as they rest. A night hag may find a particular target
  and haunt them continuously over the course of weeks, slowly and cruelly breaking
  down the victim''s will and ability to resist, until their soul is forfeit.




  A night hag is a canny mastermind and soul broker, willing to consider any deal
  as long as she is convinced she has the upper hand. Although a night hag finds it
  easy to travel the Ethereal Plane and prey upon helpless souls that can''t fight
  back, these souls are also the least desirable to the evil outsiders the night hag
  bargains with, and so a night hag gathers allies and minions that allow her to prey
  on more potent souls without personally risking herself. Their favored minions are
  nightmares, with whom they share a special bond. Above all, night hags avoid fighting
  foes that can harry them on the Ethereal Plane, picking fights only when they are
  certain they can escape.
