  description: 'Once per day, a cacodaemon can ingest the soul of a sentient creature
    within 30 feet that died within the last minute. When it does, the cacodaemon
    grows a fist-sized soul gem (Hardness 2, HP 8) in its gut and can regurgitate
    it at any time as an Interact action. Destroying the gem frees the soul within
    but does not return the deceased creature to life. The caster of a spell to return
    a creature to life whose soul is trapped within a soul gem must succeed at a DC
    30 Religion check. On a success, the soul gem shatters and the creature is returned
    to life as normal for the spell.


    By using an Interact action, a fiend can ingest a soul gem it is holding, condemning
    the soul to the fiend''s home plane. The fiend gains fast healing 5 for 1 minute.'

description: 'These embodiments of demented violence and spite are spawned from eddies
  of angry and warped souls amid Abaddon''s mists. Cacodaemons constantly hunger for
  mortal souls and yearn to create suffering. As gnashing spheres of teeth, fins,
