description: 'Gold dragons are the epitome of metallic dragonkind, unrivaled in their
  strength as well as their wisdom. They command the unwavering reverence of all other
  metallic dragons, who view gold dragons as their leaders and counselors. Golds rival
  the raw power of even red dragons, much to the chagrin of their chromatic cousins,
  and the two races are often regarded as bitter rivals. But despite their incredible
  power, gold dragons are fond of discourse and prefer to talk through solutions to
  problems rather than rely upon brute strength. Long-lived as they are, they necessarily
  take a wide view of all situations and never act without considering all possible
  options and outcomes. Because of this, gold dragons willingly converse with any
  creature that seeks them out, even evil chromatic dragons. Mortals might find this
  behavior strange, considering the longstanding war between chromatic and metallic
  dragons, but dragons know all too well that desperate situations sometimes call
  for drastic alliances. And although gold dragons might consider brief truces with
  their chromatic brethren in the case of world-ending threats, they also know when
  such alliances have run their course.




  When another metallic dragon faces a quandary or a foe beyond its own ability to
  overcome, its best option is often to seek the counsel of the eternally wise and
  gloriously righteous gold dragons. Locating these legendary beings is no easy task,
  however, for gold dragons are notoriously reclusive. Their intellect and wisdom
  is such that they prefer to ponder the great questions of life in seclusion, where
  they strive to formulate solutions to the world''s most pressing problems. As a
  result, gold dragons are sometimes absent when metallic dragons gather together,
  or are missing from tribunals where their counsel would be beneficial. Impatient
  dragons sometimes begrudge gold dragons for this apparent unreliability, but such
  aspersions are usually a result of jealousy rather than any true criticism; in their
  hearts, other dragons know that few gold dragons purposefully exclude themselves
  from truly important matters.




  A gold dragon''s incredible foresight and unparalleled enlightenment means they
  are unlikely to interfere in the business of individual mortals, though the rare
  person who captures the attention of a gold dragon is fortunate indeed, for there
  are few beings in the cosmos who can offer such prudent and considerate advice.
  Rulers and individuals in stations of high power have an easier time of garnering
  the aid of a gold dragon; entire wars have been avoided thanks to a gold dragon''s
  last-minute intermediation.




  Gold dragons are often found in warm grasslands and savannas, lands where they can
  enjoy long, meditative flights without attracting the attention of potential enemies.
  They tend to sleep either out in the open in a barren, remote place, or within a
  heavily secreted or fortified lair, such as a forgotten sink hole or in the labyrinthine
  caverns of a terrestrial chasm. Gold dragons may enlist trusted servants and allies
  to guard their lairs, though many live truly solitary lives, preferring to protect
  their hoards with nonlethal traps and magical wards.
