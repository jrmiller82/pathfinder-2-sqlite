  description: A severely damaged mechanical carny has a chance of malfunctioning.
    If a mechanical carny has 15 or fewer Hit Points at the start of its turn, it
    must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or go haywire. A haywire mechanical carny wildly
    attacks the nearest living creature, or the nearest object if no creatures are
    nearby. It takes a –1 circumstance penalty to Strikes but deals an additional
    1d6 bludgeoning damage plus __Knockdown__. This effect lasts 10 minutes or until
    the mechanical carny is destroyed.

description: Mechanical carnies are constructs manufactured to serve as entertainers,
  cleaners, and guards at carnivals and circuses. The first of these constructs was
  created by a gnome inventor who yearned for a tireless companion who could make
  her laugh and smile. Her invention was so successful that it has spawned countless
  imitations and knockoffs throughout the Inner Sea, and mechanical carnies of some
  form or another are a staple throughout metropolitan lands in both Avistan and Garund.
