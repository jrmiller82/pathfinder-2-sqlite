  effect: The bogey consumes the creature's soul. The soul is utterly destroyed—nothing
    short of wish or a similar effect can restore it to life, and only after the bogey
    has been slain. The bogey regains Hit Points equal to double the level of the
    consumed creature. After devouring three souls within a year, the bogey transforms
    into a bugaboo.

description: 'A bogey typically hunts a single creature at a time, usually a small
  child or elderly person, methodically stalking and tormenting their prey. Often
  hiding under a bed, amid a dark attic space, or in a closet left slightly ajar,
  the bogey delights in the slow, methodical cultivation of fear in its victims.
