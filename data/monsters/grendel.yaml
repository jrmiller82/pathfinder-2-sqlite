    On a hit, the creature also takes 2d6 __persistent bleed damage__ and becomes
    __wounded 1__, or increases its wounded value by 1 if already wounded. On a critical
    hit, the creature instead becomes wounded 2, or increases its wounded value by

description: 'This reaver of the cold marsh is not just a monster; he is a force of
  nature. Where there is peace and prosperity in the world, Grendel strikes, eager
  to prove that tranquility is transitory and death is the only constant. He stalks
  the edge of his fens, seeking settlements where joy holds sway. He strikes under
  cover of night, primarily targeting celebrations or festivals. The more happiness
  or joy he can extinguish, the better.




  Although Grendel is a unique creature, killing him won''t save the world from his
  ravages for long. Once Grendel''s mother instinctively feels the pain of her violent
  son''s death, she soon births a replacement. The new Grendel seems to avoid the
  sites his elder brothers terrorized, as if he instinctively knows that such a place
  hosts heroes powerful enough to defeat him.
