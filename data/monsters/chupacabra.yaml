description: 'These notorious predators have an undeniable thirst for blood. Chupacabras
  prefer to prey upon the weak and slow, often hiding in wait and watching potential
  prey for long periods before attacking. Spry and stealthy, they most often make
  their homes in areas of high grass and protective rock, their slightly reflective
  scales allowing them to blend in well with such surroundings.




  Chupacabras prefer to eat lone travelers and farm animals (particularly goats),
  and leave little evidence of their presence apart from the grisly, blood-drained
  husks of their meals. Their tendency to stay out of sight combined with their naturally
  nocturnal activity often leads superstitious locals to conclude the worst, imagining
  that a particularly reckless vampire lives in the area.




  A typical chupacabra measures nearly 5-1/2 feet from its muzzle to the tip of its
  spiny tail, and it stands just under 4 feet tall. With their slight build and lightweight
  bones, most weigh close to 100 pounds. They mate rarely and only during the hottest
  months, with the females each producing a single egg that hatches into a tiny, dehydrated
  creature. The mother typically leaves helpless prey in her cave so the hatchling
  can immediately feed.




  Although chupacabras are typically solitary creatures, they have been known to form
  small gangs in bountiful areas. Members of these groups work well together, growing
  bold enough to attack larger animals, small herds, and otherwise more dangerous
  prey. Stories of chupacabras attacking travelers or laying siege to farmhouses typically
  stem from the hunting practices of such gangs. Regions where chupacabra activity
  like this is more common often have complex and colorful myths and tall tales about
  chupacabra capabilities or motive â€”- and a few of the claims, such as that some
  chupacabras can fly, are all too true.
