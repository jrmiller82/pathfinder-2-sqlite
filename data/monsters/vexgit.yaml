description: 'These gremlins are covered head-to-toe by a crustacean-like exoskeleton
  that clacks and rattles whenever a vexgit moves. They delight in sabotaging the
  works of other creatures, often turning these works into dangerous traps. An individual
  vexgit might jam a door lock, loosen the wheels on a carriage, or remove nails from
  a boat hull. Buildings infested by vexgits become filled with traps like portcullises
  descending suddenly, water pipes exploding violently, and clock towers disgorging
  an avalanches of gears.


  Aware of their own physical weakness, vexgits carry hammers and other tools to leverage
  pieces apart or smash whatever they''re unable to disassemble. Indeed, a hammer
  sized for a human becomes a maul in the tiny hands of a vexgit.


  Vexgit infestations range from one to a score. Larger groups are often led by a
  more powerful vexgit with additional skill in thievery or primal magic. Trained
  giant rats, vipers, and rat swarms are common in vexgit lairs.
