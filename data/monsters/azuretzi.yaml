description: 'Azuretzis are sinuous, serpentine creatures with dagger-sharp teeth,
  covered in brilliant blue scales with mottled purple and pink highlights that shimmer
  in a pareidolic approximation of leering, laughing faces. The __Maelstrom''s__ chaotic
  forces spawn these small proteans from a variety of sources: physical mating between
  older azuretzis, the paradoxical promotion of bestial __naunets__, and possibly
  from mortal __petitioners__, though azuretzis may just be confusing putative mortal
  memories with experiences gained from games of mimicry. Never expect azuretzis to
  operate by any rational, self-consistent rules.




  Azuretzis represent the humor of chaos, particularly in the form of mockery and
  parody via exaggerated mimicry, twisting a target''s features into a laughingstock.
