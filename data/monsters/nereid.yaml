description: 'Nereids are aquatic fey with deep ties to water. They share some similarities
  with naiads, but they are not guardians and do not bind themselves to a specific
  body of water. Although they are primarily aquatic creatures, their unique ability
  to imbue their vitality into a supernatural shawl allows them to travel on land
  as well. A nereid must be careful when manifesting a shawl, however, as their life
  essence is bound to it, so it can be stolen or destroyed to threaten the nereid.




  Nereids prefer to exist in isolation. Left to their own devices, they avoid combat,
  but when forced to fight, their ability to transform the natural waters in their
  flesh into poison serves them as well as any weapon.




  Often, ignorant sailors lump all water-dwelling fey into a single category of “aquatic
  tempters,” regardless of the fey''s type or gender, using these creatures'' names
  interchangeably to represent the concept of a beautiful figure who exists to lure
  mortals to a drowning death. Whereas naiads have more patience and often seek to
  educate the ignorant regarding the harm that stereotypes can cause, nereids and
  rusalkas have little patience for such methods. Rusalkas are the primary source
  for the legends of fey preying upon sailors, and nereids loathe them for that, as
  they prefer to live apart from humanity and enjoy the beauty of the natural world
  in peace.




  When a nereid learns of a rusalka''s increased activity, it often seeks out the
  rusalka to route them—not so much out of an urge to protect humanoids (in whom nereids
  traditionally have little interest), but to prevent the rusalka from inadvertently
  riling up violent responses from humanoids who can''t be bothered to note the difference
  between a murderous fey and one who just wants to be left alone.
