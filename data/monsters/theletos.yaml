description: 'Theletoses maintain the balance between fate and free will. A theletos
  is a roughly spherical mass of crystals from which emerge four limbs, each split
  at the elbow and ending in three-fingered hands. A pair of crystalline tentacles
  also emerges from its body. Those who have been damaged by a theletos''s tentacles
  describe a disorienting dilemma as they simultaneously feel forced to make a single
  choice while also being overwhelmed by the endless options available to choose from.
  Theletoses are more likely than most aeons to interfere in non-aeon societies, particularly
  in regions with draconian laws. Their involvement is twofold; a theletos concerns
  itself with both the freedom of individuals and the laws that restrict these individuals,
  even (or especially) when the two are in opposition.
