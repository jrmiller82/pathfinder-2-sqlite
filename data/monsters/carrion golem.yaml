description: 'Carrion golems are foul-smelling and fly-swarmed amalgams of putrefied
  parts stitched together from many different creatures. Unlike most golems, carrion
  golems only rarely are given a humanoid form, instead appearing more twisted and
  bestial in frame. As a result, some students of golem crafting claim that the carrion
  golem isn''t a “true golem,” but regardless of those claims these foul constructs
  certainly share other golem-like traits, including their significant immunities.
  What is true is that most who craft carrion golems don''t do so out of true interest
  in the technique of golem crafting, but for the golem''s ability to spread disease.
  The crafters of carrion golems send their mindless minions to cause immediate destruction
  and leave wakes of illness and death behind them.
