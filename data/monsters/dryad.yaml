description: 'Dryads are fey guardians of the trees and creatures who dwell in wooded
  areas. They prefer using indirect methods to dissuade those who would harm their
  sacred groves and beloved forests, but they are not above using enchantments to
  enlist the aid of allies when evil threats cannot be dissuaded with words alone.
  In times of peace, dryads happily live secluded lives inside their trees, and a
  community at harmony with nature might not even realize a dryad lives nearby.




  Though they watch over all the woods around them, dryads are inextricably tied to
  a specific tree, usually an oak. Dryads who are bonded to another type of tree are
  fundamentally the same, but they may differ in temperament and appearance to match
  their ward. For instance, kraneiai, or cherry-tree dryads, have beautiful pink coloration
  and concern themselves with the fragile beauty of life.
