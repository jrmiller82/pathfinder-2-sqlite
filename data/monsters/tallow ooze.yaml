  description: When the tallow ooze critically succeeds at an attack against a creature
    or a creature escapes from being engulfed by the ooze, that creature's hands and
    gear become slick with grease. For 1d4 rounds, the affected creature must attempt
    a DC 30 Reflex save whenever it uses any item (including weapons) that must be
    wielded or held. On a failure, the creature takes a –2 circumstance penalty to
    any attack roll or check to use the item; on a critical failure, the creature
    drops the item, which lands in a random adjacent square. The creature (or an adjacent
    ally) can use 1 Interact action to wipe off the grease from an item or from its

description: 'Pale yellow and smelling of meat, this unnatural, globular monster is
  composed entirely of rendered animal fat. A tallow ooze typically results from magical
  mishaps during the creation of enchanted candles or soaps, or while rendering the
  fat of a magical beast, though occasionally spellcasters create these beings intentionally.




  A tallow ooze hunts other creatures to subsume them into its own body and absorb
  their fat. Since tallow is solid at room temperature, tallow oozes must metabolize
  their own bodies to produce enough heat to remain gelatinous. A tallow ooze that
  cannot replenish itself with absorbed fat will either consume itself or solidify,
  though a tallow ooze exposed to too much heat might melt entirely.
