  trigger: A goblin ally ends a move action adjacent to the pyro.
description: 'Some goblins take their people''s admiration of fire fully into the
  realm of deadly obsession. These pyromaniacs can be a great boon to a band of goblin
  raiders eager to torch their enemies and wreak havoc. More often, however, their
  presence is a double-edged sword; in the heat of the moment, goblin pyros sometimes
  lose sight of their tribe''s goals and simply set fire to anything that will burnâ€”including
  their own allies.
