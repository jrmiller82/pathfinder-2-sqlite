description: 'Irlgaunts resemble titanic spiders or crabs, but with cephalopod-like
  tendrils erupting from the tips of their chitin-armored legs. Their jagged gray
  shells allow them to blend into the rocky walls of the high mountain passes and
  deep ravines that serve as their hunting grounds. Despite their size, they move
  with incredible alacrity, bounding across chasms and skittering up sheer mountain
  cliffs without pause. Though they are formidable in melee, irlgaunts have an even
  more powerful ranged attack. These creatures can pelt their opponents by forcefully
  regurgitating gastrolithsâ€”melon-sized clusters of rocks enveloped in coagulated
  digestive enzymes strong enough to break down flesh and bone. Gastroliths are fragile
  and explode on contact, spraying the area with shards of rock and caustic acid.




  While one might easily mistake an irlgaunt for a simple brutish beast, they have
  a keen intelligence and use devious hunting strategies. They set traps for travelers
  and are fond of using gems and magical items taken from previous victims as bait.
  They have been known to start rockslides or otherwise block passages to reroute
  explorers into their clutches. They also use their gastroliths to direct the movements
  of their prey, forcing victims into dead ends at the edge of chasms or cliffs.




  For the most part, irlgaunts live solitary lives, likely because finding enough
  food to sustain a community tends to be difficult. However, they still maintain
  a sense of extended, regional community, actively gathering when organizing for
  war or to discuss other issues that affect their species or shared territories.
  They have been known to occasionally ally with giants, but these truces are usually
  nebulous.
