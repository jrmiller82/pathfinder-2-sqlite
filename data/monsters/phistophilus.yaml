  description: 'The contract devil produces an infernal contract for a single living
    mortal. This contract can grant a wide range of abilities and effects, akin to
    the power of a __wish__ spell but fulfilled to the letter by the contract devil.
    To receive any of those benefits, the mortal must willingly sign its true name
    to the contract. At that point, the mortal''s soul is bound to the contract devil
    and Hell.


    While the contract is in effect, the victim can''t be restored to life except
    by __wish__ or similar magic. If the mortal is restored to life by those means,
    the contract devil knows which mortal came to life and can locate the creature
    or creatures who restored the mortal to life for 1 year, gaining the effects of
    a __locate__ spell with unlimited range. Avoiding the terms of an infernal contract

description: 'Contract devils are clerks, scribes, and bureaucrats of Hell rarely
  found outside the infernal courts, and then almost always to pursue potential contracts,
  tempting mortals to sell their souls in exchange for achieving their worldly desires.
  If a target is desirable enough, a phistophilus can offer contracts for prices seemingly
  lesser than their soul all at once, though in this case, the devil carefully manipulates
  the price to drive the signatory toward the forces of law and evil, and therefore
  ultimately to Hell anyway. Contract devils are tall creatures with skin tones that
  range from bronze to crimson and large curving horns extending from their bodies,
  over which they often drape favored or important contracts.
