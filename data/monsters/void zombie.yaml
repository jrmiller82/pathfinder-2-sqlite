description: 'A void zombie arises when a humanoid dies from an __akata''s__ void
  death affliction. This walking corpse is animated by a larval akata attached to
  the deceased creature''s brain, using a grotesque feeding tendril that emerges from
  the corpse''s mouth to drink blood from its victims.




  A void zombie typically exists for only a few months before it collapses and the
  larval akata crawls free from the motionless shell. When it feels the natural end
  of its unlife approaching, a void zombie finds a secluded place to vomit forth the
  nearly mature akata larva, then withers away. The disgorged larva metamorphizes
  into a full-grown akata several hours later, usually eating the corpse as its first
  meal.




  The name “void zombie” is something of a misnomer; though still compelled by necromantic
  energies, a void zombie is a host in the life cycle of a parasitic alien, not a
  mindless, reanimated corpse (despite their similar appearances). The fact that a
  typical void zombie shares the neutral alignment of the larval akata within, rather
  than the intrinsically evil nature of other zombies, has caused some scholars to
  push to reclassify them under other names. Suggestions have included “void dead,”
  “akata spawn,” or “bloodwalker,” but the visceral and compelling commonplace name
  has proven difficult to shed.




  The driving force behind a void zombie''s violence rises from the ravenous hunger
  of the alien parasite that serves as the channel for its animating negative energies.
  Necromancers have tried often to duplicate the void zombie, but without a larval
  akata hosted within, the result is simply a zombie with missing jaws or, at best,
  one that moves faster than normal. Others have compared a captive void zombie to
  a captive yellow musk thrall (page 301) in an attempt to discover a potential link
  between the two— after all, both are animated bodies controlled by a parasitic outside
  force. Strangely, a void zombie becomes particularly violent when encountering a
  __yellow musk thrall__, making direct comparisons of the two creatures particularly
  difficult, or even dangerous. The fact that a void zombie, unlike a yellow musk
  thrall, is actually undead may hold some clues as to the source of this strange
  behavior.
