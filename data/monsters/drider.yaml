description: 'The first fleshwarping process mastered by the drow remains both their
  most successful and most infamous: the drider. Fusing the body of a drow with that
  of a giant spider, driders are a sexually dimorphic fleshwarpâ€”the only fleshwarp
  known to be able to produce young. While female driders have the upper torsos of
  elegant drow women with mouths featuring sharp poisoned fangs, male driders have
  hideous, mutated countenances that further blend the humanoid form with that of
  a spider; the difference in appearance is perhaps a reflection on the matriarchal
  nature of drow society. In combat, all driders are equally dangerous.




  Although the fleshwarping process was originally intended to be a punishment for
  drow who fell from grace, the significant powers and strengths gained from the horrifying
  transformation are attractive to some drow, and an increasing number of lower-ranking
  citizens in drow cities volunteer themselves for the painful procedure. In return
  for mandatory time (typically measured in decades) serving as a guardian, soldier,
  or other public servant, such volunteer driders are later allowed to lead their
  own lives, typically in caverns located in a city''s periphery. The painful truth
  is that for most driders, they do not live long enough to see this reward, for the
  drow have a penchant for working their fleshwarped slaves to death or deploying
  them in deadly war missions in which survival is a only a remote possibility.




  Most driders use arcane magic, but driders who use divine magic are well known,
  while a rare few use occult or primal magic. A drider''s innate spells remain the
  same regardless of the magical tradition, but those who use different types of magic
  as prepared spells may well have entirely different spells prepared than the drider
  presented below.
