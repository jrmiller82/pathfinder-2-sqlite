description: 'Jyotis are sometimes called “false phoenixes” (a term they find insulting)
  by the ignorant or willful. These avian humanoids are native to the __Positive Energy
  Plane__. They rarely leave this enigmatic realm and view visitors from other planes
  as stains on the purity of their home. Jyotis particularly distrust divine spellcasters
  and religious warriors, seeing them as inclined to take credit for manifesting a
  life force that, from the jyotis'' perspective, is as plentiful and ubiquitous as
  water is to fish.




  Despite their distrust of intruders, jyotis rarely attack unprovoked when their
  homes are not threatened. They are intolerant, however, of those who intrude on
  the palaces of crystallized light and captured flame in which they dwell. They often
  chase even those who come bearing gifts away; few visitors have anything they desire,
  for what they desire most is to be left alone. The jyotis'' full wrath is reserved
  for natives of the __Shadow Plane__ and the __Negative Energy Plane__. Historically,
  the promise of battle with the gargoyle-like __sceaduinars__, whom they consider
  it their duty to oppose, has been the only thing to lure jyoti armies beyond the
  Positive Energy Plane.
