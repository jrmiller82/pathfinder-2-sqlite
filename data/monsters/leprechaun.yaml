  effect: The leprechaun produces an item out of their hat, from behind their jacket,
    from within a hole in a tree stump, or from any other unexpected location. This
    conjured item must be no more than 1 Bulk and must be made of relatively commonplace
    material (such as cloth, wood, stone, or even low-value metal like iron or lead).
    It can't rely on intricate artistry or complex moving parts, never fulfills a
    Cost or the like, and can't be made of precious materials or materials with a
    rarity of __uncommon__ or higher. The created object is temporary and lasts for
    1 hour or until the leprechaun creates a new item, whichever comes first.

description: 'Leprechauns are mostly jovial tricksters who prefer mischief over conflict.
  They fill their days with as much fun, wine, and food as possible. Mostly found
  in forested regions, leprechauns respect nature and those who protect it.




  Leprechauns do not attack on sight. Rather, they engage in conversation and try
  to charm, cajole, or trick those they meet into doing favors for them or freely
  giving over a treasured item, usually in return for illusory wealth or false promises
  of wealth and success. These small tricksters are masters at discerning the desires
  of those they meetâ€”a knack that puts them in a powerful position when bargaining
  for goods or favors. They aren''t above turning people against each other for their
  own benefit but generally not to an extent that causes harm.




  In most cases, a leprechaun doesn''t keep a purloined possession for long. The leprechaun
  most often returns such stolen prizes just in time to defuse tensions, often as
  they point out the humor of the situation, hoping to share their amusement and mirth
  with the victim. In cases where a leprechaun''s trick goes too far and results in
  an incensed victim, the leprechaun quickly flees the conflict rather than engage
  in combat. This willingness to return stolen goods or to flee from battles fades
  as leprechauns grow older. Ancient leprechauns who have lived for thousands of years
  often spiral into dark bitterness and increasingly use their powers and illusions
  to lure those who offend them or fail to appreciate a joke into danger... or even
  death.
