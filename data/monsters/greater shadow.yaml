  description: '**Requirement** The greater shadow hit a living creature with a shadow
    hand Strike on its previous action.'
  effect: The greater shadow pulls at the target's shadow, making the creature __enfeebled
    2__ (or __enfeebled 3__ on a critical hit). This is cumulative with other __enfeebled__
    conditions from shadows, to a maximum of __enfeebled 4__. If this increases a
    creature's __enfeebled__ value to 3 or more, the target's shadow is separated
    from its body (see shadow spawn). __Enfeebled__ from Steal Shadow decreases by
    1 every hour.
