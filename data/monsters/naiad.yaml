  description: A naiad bonds to a spring, pool, pond, or similar-sized water feature.
    While within 300 feet of her bonded body of water, she can use her innate tidal
    surge at will. She doesn't recover Hit Points or reduce the drained condition
    when resting beyond that range. Unlike most other nymphs, she doesn't suffer penalties
    from being apart from her bonded body of water. A naiad can perform a 24-hour
    ritual to bond herself to a new body of water.

description: 'Naiads protect streams, ponds, springs, and other natural bodies of
  fresh water. While most naiads lead solitary lives close to their chosen ward, sometimes
  these nymphs congregate in coven-like groups where river tributaries meet, performing
  great magic and blessing the waters of the land. Because naiads'' bonds to their
  bodies of water permit more flexibility, they are the nymphs most likely to interact
  with humanoids and even visit their settlements on occasion. Unlike other nymphs,
  naiads occasionally become adventurers, especially when dark forces seek to despoil
  nature or otherwise threaten the land, joining forces with others to prevent the
  corruption of nature.
