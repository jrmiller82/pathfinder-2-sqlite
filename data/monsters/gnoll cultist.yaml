description: 'Gnoll cultists serve as their clans'' spiritual guides and conduits
  to the divine. As often as not, their influence drives entire gnoll civilizations
  to commit atrocious acts of violence and enslavement. Lamashtu and Rovagug are favored
  deities of gnoll cultists, and many gnolls believe their kind was in fact birthed
  from the womb of the Mother of Monsters. Some gnoll clans worship lesser-known demon
  lords or entire pantheons of sinister patrons.
