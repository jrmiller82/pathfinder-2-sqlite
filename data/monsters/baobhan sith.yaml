    The baobhan sith attempts an __Athletics__ check against the victim's Fortitude
    DC. On a success, the victim becomes __drained 1__ and the baobhan sith regains
    10 HP, gaining any Hit Points in excess of their maximum Hit Points as temporary
    Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a victim that's already drained doesn't restore
    any Hit Points to the baobhan sith but increases the victim's drained value by
    1. A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion,
    which requires 10 minutes, a successful DC 20 __Medicine__ check, and sufficient
    blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1.

description: 'Undeath is rare in the fey realm of the First World, for that plane''s
  infusion with the raw power of life makes undead uncomfortable at best. Yet a few
  fey have adopted the vile practices and habits of notorious undead while still being
  living themselves, as seen in the blood-drinking habits of the murderous baobhan
  sith.




  A baobhan sith avoids confrontations when outnumbered, and although territorial,
  they won''t reveal their true nature to larger groups. They prefer to drink blood
  from victims they find attractive, and they avoid drinking blood from animals and
  beasts entirely, as they consider such activities to be uncultured.
