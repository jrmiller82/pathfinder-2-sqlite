description: 'These fabled beasts resemble massive snakes with long rows of finned
  spines down their back. Temperamental and territorial, sea serpents can capsize
  a boat with ease, and most won''t hesitate to do so when hungry or threatened. Stories
  abound of aggrieved captains who spend their entire lives hunting down the elusive
  monster that sunk their ships and took their livelihoods. These hunts rely on rumors
  and glimpses of the beasts, as few survive the catastrophes wrought by sea serpents.




  While many fishermen''s tales paint sea serpents as divinely appointed guardians
  of the ocean or, alternately, as evil and demonic agents, the truth is that most
  sea serpents are simply very large beasts with a knack for avoiding magical detection.
