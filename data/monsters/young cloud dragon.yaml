description: 'At heart, cloud dragons are wanderers, explorers, and travelers who
  enjoy nothing more than seeing new lands and meeting unusual creatures. Cloud dragons
  range in color from light blue to a pale, milky white and have thick, curling horns
  and rather short snouts. They keep lairs among the extreme altitudes of the highest
  mountain peaks but are away on their many journeys as often as they''re at home.
  Cloud dragons spend long hours surveying the lands they fly over from great heights,
  but they are creatures of whim, making it hard to predict what will pique their
  curiosity and bring them winging down to converse or investigate something on the
  ground. Cloud dragons seldom perform acts of outright malice, but they are not often
  charitable either. A cloud dragon is as likely to simply pluck something they desire
  off the ground and fly away with it as they are to bargain fairly.




  A cloud dragon''s ever-changing interests never seem to stray toward the complicated
  schemes and long-term plans of other dragons. These rovers are creatures of the
  moment, and although they are as mentally gifted as other true dragons, their interests
  remain in the here and now. Yet the cloud dragon''s penchant for living in the moment
  is not a personality flaw—they''re more than capable of anticipating long-term results
  of their actions and won''t make foolish choices simply to pursue a current interest.
  At the same time, cloud dragons have little interest in worrying about the future
  and are as confident in their ability to handle tomorrow''s problems as they are
  today''s.




  Cloud dragon hoards tend to be well-guarded or well-hidden, as a natural result
  of their roving habits often taking them away from their lairs for extended periods.
  Their treasuries include a wide variety of items—they are driven to gather a broad
  range of prizes rather than collecting one type of item intensively. To a cloud
  dragon, a diversified hoard is a perfect hoard.
