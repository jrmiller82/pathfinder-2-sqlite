description: 'Aurumvoraxes are highly aggressive and territorial predators that sprint
  on eight legs, using their terrific strength and iron-hard claws to dig through
  solid stone. A typical aurumvorax is only 3 feet long but weighs more than 200 pounds,
  for its thick, sturdy bones are densely packed with muscle, making the creature
  very strong but a notoriously poor swimmer. Its fur is golden, sometimes with a
  silvery or russet tone depending on the metals it has ingested, and its claws are
  always the shiny black of seasoned iron.




  Aurumvorax adults claim hunting territories spanning a mile or more, driving out
  other predators and leading solitary lives except when they mate. They are irascible
  creatures, impossible to train as adults, but daring trainers can rear aurumvorax
  pups as deadly guard beasts, which they sell for hundreds of gold pieces to discriminating
  buyers. Aurumvorax pups are usually single births, and their mothers are fiercely
  protective, making their acquisition a dangerous proposition. Even when trained,
  the creatures are prone to dangerous bursts of rage.
