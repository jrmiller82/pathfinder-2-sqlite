description: 'Capricious and always eager to share a good laugh, copper dragons are
  among the wiliest of the metallic dragons, but this by no means interferes with
  their mission to spread freedom in oppressive lands. Copper dragons are hedonists
  who are quick to indulge in simple pleasures, but they''re also sympathetic to other
  creatures, slow to pass judgment, and careful to always examine a situation from
  as many perspectives as possible. This philosophy has its drawbacks, however, as
  copper dragons are susceptible to negative influences and prone to forgiving the
  less serious evil acts performed by their chromatic cousins and other cruel creatures.
  Copper dragons also have a difficult time keeping their temper in check once they
  are roused to anger.




  Copper dragons tend to lair in warm or temperate hills, but due to their nature,
  they move their lairs every few years. They sometimes live among other people, especially
  any dwarves who reside nearby. Some copper dragons even worship gods typically worshipped
  only by humanoids. Among these dragons, worship of Cayden Cailean is most popular,
  as they see his love of freedom and penchant for alcohol aligning with the typical
  copper dragon mindset.




  A copper dragon''s combat tactics are as unorthodox as its sense of humor, as it
  is more likely to use mockery and tricks than outright strength to win its battles.
  As a copper dragon ages, it perfects jokes capable of rendering its foes helpless
  with laughter.
