description: 'Though capable of the same depths of cruelty as their fire mephit kin,
  ice mephits carry theirs out in a more calculating way. Unlike most mephits, these
  pale blue mephits prefer solitude to company. Lacking in empathy, they are known
  for their callousness, and have a reputation for brutal honesty. They also have
  few moral qualms about acting selfishly and exploiting weakness for their own gain,
  should the chance arise.
