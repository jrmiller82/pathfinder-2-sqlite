description: 'No mere animals, giant eagles have a keen intellect and a strong sense
  of honor. As guardians of their mountain homes, giant eagles attempt to prevent
  the encroachment of civilization upon wild land and the predations of wicked humanoid
  settlements. Unlike ordinary eagles, which tend to be solitary creatures, giant
  eagles congregate within aeries holding up to a dozen members and work together
  to protect their domains.




  Giant eagles have wingspans up to 30 feet across and weigh up to 500 pounds. These
  impressive birds cannot be easily broken or cowed. A giant eagle may allow trusted
  terrestrial friends to ride it, but they invariably resist saddles, harnesses, or
  other equipment that might suggest they are mere beasts of burden rather than trusted
  companions. Giant eagles are long-lived and take debts and oaths very seriously,
  often remembering slights for years and remaining slow to forgive.
