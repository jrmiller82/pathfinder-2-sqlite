  description: The dig-widget Leaps up 20 feet onto a creature or object and attempts
    a corkscrew Strike against it. If the Strike damages the target, the dig-widget
    attaches to the target (typically to the back of a creature). This is similar
    to __Grabbing__ the creature, but the dig-widget moves with that creature rather
    than holding it in place. While attached, the dig-widget can't use its corkscrew.

description: 'Thieves covet dig-widgets, specialized constructs built for infiltration.
  Each dig-widget contains numerous simple tools, including a set of mechanical devices
  that function as __thieves'' tools__, two arms with drills, and two arms with corkscrews
  for attaching to and climbing surfaces. Once activated, these devices propel themselves
  forward. Though they have the full faculties typical of a construct, they usually
  follow a simple routine: avoid notice, pick any lock barring the path, dig past
  obstacles, and attack if caught. They''re rarely left unattended, as a thief needs
  to be nearby to follow after-both to steal goods and to stop the dig-widget from
  engaging in further larceny once it''s achieved its goal.




  The source of a dig-widget''s power is as much mechanical as it is magical. The
  gears and springs that provide a dig-widget mobility are an improvement over more
  primitive true clockwork creations (whose functions require constant winding to
  remain mobile), but at the cost of security, for a dig-widget''s moving parts can
  be dismantled quickly by thieves and others with the proper training.
