description: 'These omnivorous birds are cunning and opportunistic scavengers. Capable
  of solving simple puzzles in order to retrieve desired items, ravens gather at the
  periphery of civilization, raiding it as needed when they are not hunting in the
  wilds. Whether singularly, in pairs, or as a flock, ravens live off scraps as often
  as they do carrion or prey. They are also unusually social among their own kind,
  even alerting other ravens to large carcasses with loud, croaking cries; it is rumored
  that this extends between flocks as well.
