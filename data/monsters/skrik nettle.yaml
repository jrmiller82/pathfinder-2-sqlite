    A levitating creature takes a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls. It can

    across the surface by climbing (if the surface is vertical) or crawling (if the
    surface is horizontal, such as a ceiling). A flying creature can move normally
    but still increases its altitude as appropriate from the venom. A creature that
    can''t fly falls as soon as it recovers from skrik nettle venom.'

description: 'The expansive skies of the __First World__ are home to skrik nettles—delicate,
  bizarre-looking creatures that resemble large jellyfishes. A fringe of brightly
  colored feathers circles their bodies, and long tendrils trail from their center,
  each ending in a snapping beak. Known for their eerie, chirping melodies, skrik
  nettles soar above the First World in flocks of a dozen or more, diligently scavenging
  for food in the fey realm''s cutthroat ecosystem. When hunting or provoked, skrik
  nettles attack their foes by injecting them with a magical poison that causes the
  victim to float helplessly up into the sky. Skrik nettles continuously inject this
  poison into their helpless prey until it dies or is so high up that the skrik nettle
  needs only wait for the poison to end, its meal crashing helplessly to the ground
  below.




  Skrik nettles that find their way to the Material Plane (or any plane other than
  the First World, for that matter) tend to be much more aggressive, for the planar
  energies that they find comforting and soothing on the First World are conspicuously
  absent. The first few minutes after a skrik nettle arrives on any plane but the
  First World tend to be filled with violence and fear, as the panicking creature
  lashes out at any nearby creatures (including other skrik nettles) in the mistaken
  notion that these others are somehow responsible for the discomforting change. After
  10 minutes or so, assuming the skrik nettle survives its bout of violence, the creature
  calms down somewhat and does its best to acclimate to its new home. Yet even skrik
  nettles who find themselves marooned beyond the First World for years never lose
  their longing for home, and they instinctively seek out portals to this plane for
  the rest of their lives.
