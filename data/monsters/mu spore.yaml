description: 'A mu spore is a thankfully rare fungoid monstrosity of vast power and
  strange intellect. Even the smallest mu spores are never less than a hundred feet
  long from tentacle tip to tentacle tip, yet despite this vast bulk, they are capable
  of flying with an uncommon grace, venting jets of foul-smelling spores to guide
  their flight.




  Many societies tell tales of vast mu spores appearing over cities at the dawn of
  apocalyptic events, but they''re more than just ravenous eaters of nations. Mu spores
  often possess rare or esoteric knowledge, and if peaceful contact can be made, this
  lore can be quite valuable. Their spores can also be used to craft certain foul
  drugs or deadly alchemical poisons, but harvesting these ingredients is dangerous,
  as the spores are not viable for long once they''ve been shed, forcing alchemists
  seeking to harvest them to operate in perilously close proximity to the abominations.
