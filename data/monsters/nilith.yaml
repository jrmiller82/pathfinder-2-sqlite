  effect: The nilith reaches into the mind of the grabbed creature and implants disjointed
    images of the victim's worst fears and nightmares. The grabbed creature takes
    6d6 mental damage (DC 31 basic Will save). On a critical failure, the target is
    also affected as though by __feeblemind__, and it must attempt a second Will save
    against that effect.

description: 'The sleek, dark niliths resemble hairless, emaciated tree sloths. These
  creatures are intensely dangerous and fearsome, with red glowing eyes, wicked claws,
  and mouths full of needlelike teeth. Niliths feed off the emotions, fears, and flesh
  of the living, and folktales posit that those who have nightmares of these creatures
  are fated to one day be eaten by them. Niliths draw intense joy from tormenting
  sapient creatures, often focusing their predations on the pious and the just, from
  whom they draw forth their most basic fears and worst thoughts and revel in their
  victims'' subsequent terror. More often than not, these despicable manipulators
  wish to drive their victims into madness and even to suicide. Most niliths lack
  the patience to spend too much time fully tearing down an individual, and when a
  nilith tires of its current plaything and becomes bored with its particular thoughts
  and fears, it murders the quarry before feeding on its flesh and moving onto the
  next victim.




  Niliths are actually extensions of much deadlier creatures that dwell in a distant
  dimension beyond dreamsâ€”in a way, niliths are little more than remote feeding machines
  for the unknown alien entities to which they are connected. Scholars and dimensional
  travelers have attempted to uncover the exact mechanisms of this mysterious connection,
  but they have yet to decipher the truth. Indeed, many who investigate the nature
  of the nilith''s bond are driven to madness before getting anywhere close. The odd
  connection to otherworldly beings might help explain the longevity of these creatures,
  as it is believed that niliths can live for thousands of years.




  Thankfully for others, niliths are solitary creatures that hate the company of their
  own kind, likely because these harbingers of nightmares have no wish to taste the
  horrors they bring to others.
