description: 'The purple worm is the most common and infamous of the cave worms, a
  much-feared monster wandering the twisting tunnels of the Darklands that is capable
  of carving out entire cave systems. Tunnels bored by a purple worm don''t always
  last long after these creature''s passage, and areas where they nest are maddening
  mazes of passageways that lead nowhere, yet navigating the labyrinth to find the
  worm''s central nest often yields amazing treasures left behind by the worm''s prior
  victims.
