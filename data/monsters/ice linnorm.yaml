  description: The ice linnorm spews out a blast of freezing, viscous ooze in a 60-foot
    cone that deals 15d6 cold damage to creatures within the area (DC 38 basic Reflex
    save). The freezing ooze clings to those struck and hardens into thick sheets
    of ice. A creature that fails the saving throw is __immobilized__ by the ice until
    it succeeds at a check to Escape or it or an ally Forces Open the ice (DC 34 for
    either case). At the start of its turn, a creature still immobilized by the ice
    takes 4d6 cold damage. Another creature can free a frozen target by dealing a
    total of 20 fire damage to the frozen target. Left unattended, the ice crumbles
    away in 1 minute on its own. Creatures with the fire trait can't be frozen in
    place by this breath weapon. Flying creatures fall if frozen, and swimming creatures
    that are frozen rise toward the surface of the water at a speed of 60 feet per
    round. An ice linnorm can't use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.
