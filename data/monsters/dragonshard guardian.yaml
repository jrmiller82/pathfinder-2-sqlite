  effect: The dragonshard guardian's body absorbs the energy entirely, preventing
    the damage from harming the construct. Its body reverberates and transforms the
    absorbed energy before projecting it outward in a 60-foot burst. Each creature
    within the burst takes an amount of fire damage equal to the amount of energy
    damage absorbed by the triggering attack, including any damage resisted by the
    guardian's resistances and additional damage from its weakness (DC 45 basic Reflex
    save). This fire damage doesn't harm objects or constructs.
