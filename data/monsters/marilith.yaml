description: 'Mariliths are the generals of the Abyss, formed from the souls of proud
  evil mortals, often warlords and despots. They appear as tall and powerfully built
  humans from the waist up with snake tails and six arms. Because of Lamashtu''s prominence
  over other demonic deities, most pride demons encountered by mortals take female
  form, but they can be of any gender.




  Mariliths are among the greatest tacticians in the Abyss, and they have an almost
  supernatural knack for understanding the ripples of chaos and the unpredictable
  nature of demonic life. Their ability to command armies rises as much from their
  commanding presence as it does their ability to read into the potential results
  of any possible act and a sufficient understanding of the flow of entropy to allow
  them to predict likely outcomes.
