description: 'The grotesque brain collectors (or neh-thalggus, as they call themselves)
  originate from worlds far beyond the known solar system, and are part of a conglomeration
  of hostile aliens known collectively as the Dominion of the Black. Whether driven
  by their own schemes or directives from sinister overlords, brain collectors arrive
  in living starships to harvest the brains of intelligent creatures. These aberrations
  draw no nutrition from brains, instead storing them for analysis and as vessels
  for occult magical energies.




  A brain collector''s form evokes that of a tailless scorpion, but the pulsing brain-filled
  blisters that glisten along its back make them impossible to mistake for merely
  oversized arachnids. Baleful eyes glare from the joints on their legs, and the unsettling,
  intrusive whisper-thoughts they telepathically broadcast into the minds of those
  they seek to feed on can be interpreted as threats or promises alike.




  Brain collectors have very little empathy for the denizens of any world they visit,
  despite the fact that certain cults venerate them, or the Dominion they hail from,
  as if they were gods. To brain collectors, terrestrial creatures are simply resources
  for their magical needs and occult powers. They have little interest in worshipping
  gods or being worshipped themselves, yet they do practice strange forms of religion
  of their own, in which they consider the primordial forces of deep space as worthy
  of faith and fear.
