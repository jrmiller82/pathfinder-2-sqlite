description: 'Strange creatures born from jagged crystals in the heart of the __Negative
  Energy Plane__, sceaduinar are fueled by its negative energy and driven to extinguish
  all life. Resembling crystalline gargoyles with serrated limbs and sharp, bat-like
  faces, sceaduinar stand about 7 feet tall and weigh around 100 pounds.




  These malevolent beings sometimes gather in great packs of their own kind. Despite
  their intelligence, they act like cunning, feral beasts for the most part, though
  they occasionally build tools to aid them in extinguishing life. Sceaduinar sail
  through the great voids of their home plane, seeking to destroy any sparks of life
  that find their way into that deadly realm—even the twisted sparks found in undead
  creatures.




  When they discover portals to other planes, sceaduinar swarm through in great numbers,
  slaughtering all they come across. While dwelling outside the Negative Energy plane
  is uncomfortable for sceaduinar, they can exist for extended periods of time apart
  from their home. Of course, the feeling of a plane where negative energy isn''t
  the rule doesn''t improve these creatures'' attitude, and as a result, they tend
  to be particularly cruel and violent when encountered in such realms.
