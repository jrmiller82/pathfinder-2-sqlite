  description: A creature hit by the giant toad's tongue becomes __grabbed__ by the
    giant toad. The creature isn't __immobilized__, but it can't move beyond the reach
    of the toad's tongue. A creature can sever the tongue with a successful Strike
    against AC 15 that deals at least 6 slashing damage. This deals no damage to the
    toad but prevents it from using its tongue Strike until it regrows its tongue,
    which takes a week.

description: 'Most giant toads live in dry environments, particularly deserts, and
  eagerly eat almost any creature smaller than themselves. They''re known to eat giant
  rats, then take over the rats'' burrows as homes. Giant toads have large poison
  glands behind their eyes that enable them to coat their skin with poison. This leads
  to them having very few natural predators, and populations can quickly explode if
  left unchecked. While most consider giant toads dangerous pests, some groups of
  __ogres__ and __hill giants__ cultivate them to collect their poison for recreational
  use.
