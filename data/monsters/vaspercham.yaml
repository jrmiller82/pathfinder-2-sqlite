description: 'The darkly intelligent vaspercham, an aquatic horror who delights in
  violence and destruction, lurks in the shallows near shorelines. Once a vaspercham
  settles on a new home, they stubbornly stay there, regardless of any communities
  dwelling nearby. A vaspercham''s physical might and magic-warping abilities make
  them incredibly hard to dislodge once entrenched, and many seaside communities have
  relocated after a vaspercham came calling. The monster responds only to strength,
  so one must best a vaspercham in combat to gain their begrudging cooperation. But
  once the creature recovers their strength, they inevitably betray any temporary
  alliance.
