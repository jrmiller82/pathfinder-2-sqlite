  raw_description: '**Living Shield** A shield archon''s shield is the focal point
    of its courage and soul. It always has its shield raised without needing to Raise
    a Shield, and it can use Shield Block as a free action instead of a reaction (Hardness
    10, HP 80). A shield archon can trigger its Shield Block free action when an ally
    within 10 feet is the target of an attack, reducing damage to that ally instead
    of itself but otherwise following the normal rules of Shield Block.**Menacing
    Guardian** (__aura__, __divine__, __enchantment__) 30 feet. Enemies that start
    their turn in the area or enter it must attempt a DC 27 Will save. On a failure,
    they take a â€“1 status penalty to attack rolls, spell rolls, and damage rolls against
    any other target while in the aura for 24 hours or until they damage the archon,
    whichever comes first. On a critical failure, they can''t use hostile actions
    against any other target while in the area for 24 hours or until they damage the
    archon, whichever comes first. Regardless of the result, a creature is then temporarily
    immune to further menacing guardian auras for 24 hours.**Retributive Strike**

description: 'Shield archons defend the fortresses of Heaven against fiendish incursions.
  They wield their spears and shields in massive formations capable of withstanding
  any onslaught. Beneath their armor, they are sheathed in skin of steel. Given their
  tremendous strength and imposing stature, shield archons are ideal guardians of
  the meek and are sometimes summoned to the Material Plane to ward off the attacks
  of great numbers of evildoers.
