  description: 'A creature struck by one of the harrow doll''s cards must attempt
    a DC 25 Will save or be cursed with misfortune, which forces the creature to roll
    twice and take the lower result on its next roll of a specific type, determined
    by the card''s suit (roll 1d6 to randomly determine the suit). A creature can
    be cursed with only one effect from harrowing misfortune at a time, with a new
    curse overriding any previous curse. The curse ends after 1 minute or after the
    specified roll is made, whichever comes first. The suits and their effects are:
    Hammers (melee attack roll), Keys (Reflex save), Shields (Fortitude save), Books
    (skill check), Stars (Will save), and Crowns (spell attack roll).'

description: 'Harrow dolls are unique constructs that can make predictions about the
  future. The more elite circuses and traveling shows frequently feature a harrow
  doll, and many use the doll''s abilities to learn more about locals to better customize
  shows to their tastes—or to find easy marks for later cons. Upset patrons that try
  to harm a harrow doll or reclaim their payment quickly learn that the construct
  is more than capable of defending itself.

  description: A harrow doll can cast __augury__ as part of a harrow reading, which
    takes the usual 10 minutes. When casting __locate__, the harrow doll doesn't need
    to have previously observed a specific object to learn its direction, but instead
    can detail the direction only vaguely, using such phrases as “beside a weeping
    mound” or “beneath the lost sky.” When the harrow doll casts __mind reading__,
    there is no effect if the target critically succeeds its save. Each time a harrow
    doll makes a harrow reading, it also changes which saving throw is affected by
    its fortune's favor ability.
