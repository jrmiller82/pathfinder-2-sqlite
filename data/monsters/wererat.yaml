description: 'Wererats tend to be selfishly opportunistic, avaricious, and paranoid
  as a result of their curse. Because wererats typically dwell in metropolitan areas
  where they can hide in plain sight, practically any city-goer could be a wererat
  in disguiseâ€”from the quiet shopkeep to the city''s criminal mastermind. The bustle
  of crowds and countless rat-holes make ghettos and shantytowns favored homes for
  wererats, especially since in these poorer districts the wererat can kill out of
  greed or fear with little chance of the authorities noticing. In some cities, wererats
  operate entire thieves'' guilds or organized crime rings, and membership requires
  willfully submitting to the wererat''s cursed bite. Wererats look very similar to
  ratfolk when in hybrid form, apart from potential differences in size, but ratfolk
  have no love for these monsters.
