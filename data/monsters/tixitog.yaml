description: 'Tixitogs are a species of bizarre aberrations that make their homes
  in the dens of giant spiders. Immune to poison and able to traverse sticky webs
  thanks to the thick slime that covers their bodies, tixitogs steal food cocooned
  in spider lairs and prey on spiders themselves, but they are careful never to kill
  so many that their food supply runs out. Their favorite meal, however, is the odd
  adventurer or spelunker who stumbles into their nest.




  These strange creatures have oblong bodies coated in a viscous and transparent slime,
  three large black eyes, and eight thick, multi-jointed limbs, four of which are
  inverted and point upward, allowing the monster to easily crawl on either the ceiling
  or floor of narrow caverns and squeeze through narrow spaces. Their jaws appear
  small and tubular when closed but peel apart and stretch to terrifying proportions
  when opened, as their dozens of pointed teeth part to reveal a freakishly long tongue.




  A tixitog usually hides from the spiders in the lair it has claimed, not out of
  fear but to keep the spiders from abandoning the lair and moving elsewhere. When
  a tixitog emerges from the shadows, most spiders flee from it rather than attack,
  and the tixitog uses this behavior to direct entire swarms of spiders where it pleases.
  This is typically bad news for bands of adventurers who find themselves within a
  tixitog''s lair; in the mass hysteria caused by a skittering swarm of spiders headed
  straight toward them, spelunkers typically fail to notice the more dangerous threat
  that follows closely behind.
