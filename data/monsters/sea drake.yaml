description: 'Long and slender, sea drakes have fins down the length of their backs

  ocean waves as the skies above. More solitary than most drakes, they hunt and live
  alone. Although most sea drakes make their roosts high on ocean-facing cliffs, it
  isn''t unheard of for them to dwell in underwater caves, living entirely aquatic
  lives.
