description: 'Shoggti travel to other planes in roving bands to capture and charm
  victims, bringing them back to the __Abyss__ where they are enslaved for unknown—but
  no doubt insidiously evil—purposes. These squid-like qlippoth have slick, blue skin
  and four suckered tentacles that end in dexterous pincers. In addition to a lamprey-like
  mouth at the base of its body, each has a secondary maw in the middle of its forehead
  that stretches from between its two bulging eyes to the back of its head.
