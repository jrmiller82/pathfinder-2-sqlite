description: 'Xulgath gutragers exhibit more extreme developments along the same physiological
  path as their __bilebearer__ cousins. They are stockier and faster, with necks and
  limbs corded with muscle. They are also denser, with multiple stomachs full of fluids
  even more caustic than those of the bilebearer. Like the bilebearer, gutragers lack
  the distinctive stench typical of most xulgaths.




  A gutrager''s torso conceals its most disturbing featureâ€”a densely coiled esophagus.
  Pressurized bladders and a muscular throat allow the gutrager to propel its esophagus
  outward in an explosion of yellow flesh and acidic bile; caustic stomach acid coating
  the esophagus makes even brief physical contact with the organ dangerous. As a last
  resort, the gutrager can intentionally accelerate the corrosion in its esophagus,
  releasing vile acid in a burst that also ends its life.
