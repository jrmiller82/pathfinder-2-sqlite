description: 'Ogre gluttons take the act of feeding to a horrific extreme, capable
  of extending their already cavernous mouths wide enough to gulp down a halfling.
  Stories of ogre gluttons being tricked into eating razor-edged shields or barrels
  filled with poisoned meat are common, but such tales are of little consolation to
  those who have been gobbled down whole by these ravenous giants. In addition to
  their sadistic table manners, ogre gluttons have a disturbing knack for coming up
  with violent “games” that are little more than drawn-out torments, yet those who
  somehow manage to beat a glutton at the rules of its own game can often enrage and
  frustrate the ogre enough that the resulting tantrum is more than enough distraction
  to afford a last-ditch escape from doom.
