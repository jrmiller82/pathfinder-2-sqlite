  an animal. The hands of a raja rakshasa are more subtly unsettling, for the fingers
  of these fiends bend outward, away from the palms.




  More than any other types of rakshasa, rajas scoff at religion. They understand
  the power of the divine, yet they view themselves as the only things worthy of worship
  from mortal creatures; not even their own immortals are deemed deserving of such
  glorification. Raja rakshasas often form close-knit families that work together
  to bring down mortal cities or to rule them from the shadows within. Such families
  of rakshasas often incorporate other breeds of the fiend, often using dandasukas
  as favored servants or stealthy spies. Even though a raja family works together
  to achieve a shared goal, infighting and treachery among their own is a constant
  threat.
