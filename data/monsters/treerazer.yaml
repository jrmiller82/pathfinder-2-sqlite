    parodies of their natural shapes. A living creature in this area must succeed
    at a DC 47 Fortitude save each round or become partially transformed into plantlike
    matter. Those who fail this saving throw are treated as if they were plants for
    the purposes of any effect that particularly harms or inconveniences plant creatures
    more than other creatures, but do not gain any benefits of being plant creatures.
    This effect lasts as long as the creature remains within the area of corruption
    and for 1 minute thereafter.

description: 'Treerazer, the self-styled Lord of the Blasted Tarn, is a powerful demon
  on the cusp of ascending to the true power of one of the rulers of the Abyss itself—a
  demon lord. For now, even as a nascent demon lord, Treerazer is a dangerous foe.




  Treerazer rarely leaves his swampy realm of Tanglebriar—a large thicket of tainted
  foliage and rotting detritus just south of Kyonin''s Fierani Forest—but can be encountered
  anywhere within that toxic mire, often accompanied by a small legion of demons,
  corrupted fey, and other deadly allies. Certain occult rituals have the power to
  call him forth from Tanglebriar, granting him the opportunity to directly work his
  evils beyond the realm to which he has been exiled. Some believe that no eldritch
  force contains Treerazer and that, were he willing, he could travel Golarion with
  impunity, spreading the twisted blessings of his touch and the corruption of his
  presence, yet the Lord of the Blasted Tarn is as cunning and canny as he is deadly,
  and prefers to work his evils on the world from the safety of his nightmare realm.
