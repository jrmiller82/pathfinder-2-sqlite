  description: A creature hit by the giant frog's tongue becomes __grabbed__ by the
    giant frog. The creature isn't __immobilized__, but it can't move beyond the reach
    of the frog's tongue. A creature can sever the tongue with a Strike against AC
    13 that deals at least 2 slashing damage. This deals no damage to the frog but
    prevents it from using its tongue Strike until it regrows its tongue, which takes
    a week.
