  description: A group of six jinkins can work together for an hour to imbue an item
    with a curse at a range of 60 feet. While this process is lengthy, it's also unobtrusive
    and can be performed while Hiding. Jinkins prefer to use this ability on magic
    items. The curse makes the item unreliable (DC 5 flat check or waste any action
    to Interact with or Activate the item), adds a bizarre requirement to use the
    item, or imparts some other curse of a similar caliber.

description: 'Jinkins are sadistic tinkers who steal and sabotage items and take great
  pride in their power to curse precious objects. They hold grudges and create convoluted
  plans for revenge whenever they feel slighted, such as when a creature dares to
  remove one of their curses. Rarely content to wreak simple mayhem, jinkins also
  take immense pleasure in torture and murder, though they prefer to lead victims
  into traps designed to capture or incapacitate rather than kill outright. Deep pits
  are favorites, since victims who survive the fall face a slow death from starvation
  and thirst. Jinkins enjoy gathering at the edge of pits to mock, tease, and torment.
