  effect: The urdefhan lets out a battle cry, sending itself and its allies into a
    fanatical frenzy. Each ally that hears the call gains a +4 status bonus to attack
    rolls, damage rolls, and a +2 status bonus to saving throws, and takes a -2 status
    penalty to AC. Affected allies must use at least one of their actions to Strike
    each round, if they are able (even if it means attacking an ally, object, or thin
    air). This lasts for 2d4 rounds.
