  description: The hodag Strides, then makes a Strike against a target in reach. If
    it moves at least 20 feet and succeeds at its Strike, the hodag deals damage normally
    and then attempts an __Athletics__ check against the creature's Fortitude DC to
    toss the enemy into the air. On a success, the tossed creature is thrown 10 feet
    in a straight line in the direction of the hodag's choice and then lands __prone__.
    If the creature is knocked into a solid object, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage
    as well before landing prone. The hodag can instead toss a creature straight up
    in the air. The creature lands in the same square where it started, takes 1d6
    bludgeoning damage, and lands prone.

description: 'Because they are often described only in drunken retellings of loggers''
  or miners'' tales, hodags are considered by many to exist only in the local folklore
  of remote areas. However, some individuals have actually encountered these dangerous
  beasts firsthand, and even fewer have lived to tell their tales.




  Hodags are reptilian creatures the size of bulls. These vicious predators'' long
  claws can tear creatures apart in seconds. Their backs sport dozens of long spines
  that run from their snouts all the way down the length of their powerful tails.
  Their wide mouths are full of sharp and twisted rows of teeth not unlike those of
  a shark. The hodags'' rough, scaly hides carry hues of green and brown, allowing
  them to blend into their forest surroundings where they ambush prey. Only their
  glowing red eyes reveal their presence, though hodags have learned to use this to
  their advantage by drawing attention to their eyes in one area, then closing their
  eyes and stealthily moving to another area to cause their prey to misconstrue their
  location.




  In the wintertime, when snow and ice blankets a region, hodags grow a foul-smelling
  coat of greasy, dark-brown fur that sprouts in tufts from between their scales.
  A typical hodag measures over 10 feet long from snout to tail and weighs upward
  of 700 pounds.
