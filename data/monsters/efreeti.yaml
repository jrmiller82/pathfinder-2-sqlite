description: 'The efreet are hateful and merciless genies from the Plane of Fire,
  where they build metropolises and massive trade centers that draw extraplanar travelers
  from across the multiverse. They are cruel slavers, vengeful warmongers, and sinister
  wish-masters; there are many tales of mortals who made pacts with efreet only to
  have their words twisted to suit a genie''s capricious and malevolent whims.


  Efreet do not readily treat with other genies; they share an eternal feud with the
  djinn, disdain marids, regard jann as weaklings unworthy of the genie title, and
  only occasionally tolerate alliances with shaitans. At 12 feet tall and weighing
  2,000 pounds, efreet are formidable opponents and cow their chosen victims with
  a glance.
