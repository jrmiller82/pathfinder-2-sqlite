description: 'Slavers and raiders from the cold, windswept dimension of Leng, these
  malevolent humanoids range across reality in ominous black ships capable of sailing
  beyond the borders of dimensions and planes. Although most denizens of Leng seek
  slaves and plunder like any pirate, others operate as self-styled ambassadors and
  merchants, sowing discord with far-ranging plots. While the inscrutable denizens
  dress themselves in flowing robes, veils, and broad turbans to appear human, their
  aberrant physiology, when glimpsed, is evident from their crown of stubby horns
  and tentacled jaws to their furry, goat-like legs.




  Above the fierce captains who command the infamous black ships are an even higher
  caste of denizens of Leng. These cultists and musicians serve as high priests, laboring
  to appease the frightening gods who look down upon the Nightmare Realm with cold
  malice.
