description: 'The art of golem animation is not limited to societies with access to
  expensive crafting materials or a long history of arcane mastery. Among the resource-poor
  __xulgaths__ who dwell in the Darklands, especially those hardy clutches that call
  the Black Desert their home, obsidian is one of the most common crafting materials
  available. Combine this ingredient with a powerful spellcaster and the xulgath tradition
  of inflection—magically warping and working normally inflexible stone—and the end
  result is an obsidian golem.
