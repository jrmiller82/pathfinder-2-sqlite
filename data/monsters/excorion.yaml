  description: The excorion plants a magical handprint on the target, marking them
    as chosen for death. The excorion makes a fist Strike against an adjacent creature;
    this does not count toward the excorion's multiple attack penalty. On a hit, the
    attack does no damage, but the creature becomes __observed__ to every excorion
    within 60 feet, even if an excorion's line of sight would be blocked by a wall
    or other obstacle. This effect lasts until the handprint is washed off, which
    requires water and spending 3 actions to fully clean off.

  effect: The excorion sacrifices itself and transfers its bloody, vital energy to
    a willing living creature within 30 feet. The excorion is immediately destroyed,
    and the targeted living creature heals a number of HP equal to half the excorion's
    remaining HP at the time that it used this ability. The living creature is __slowed
    1__ during its next turn as its body adjusts to the newly transfused blood and
    vital energy; the living creature also counts as an excorion for 1 minute for
    the purpose of seeing other excorions' Bloody Handprint marks.

description: 'These hideous undead creatures result from an exquisitely painful necromantic
  process where flayed humanoids are animated through their exposed blood vessels.
  Cults of undeath typically punish apostates and renegades with this cruel method
  of reanimation, though sacrificial victims or unfortunate prisoners might suffer
  a similar fate. Excorions have supernaturally strong, pulsing veins that extend
  outward from their bodies like thousands of tiny, bloody cilia.




  Excorions move their bulks not with their dead muscles, but with heaving contractions
  of their blood vessels that pull them along in a swift but jerky manner. Excorions
  can shift their magical blood easily throughout their bodies, allowing them to squirt
  blood from their gaping, skinless mouths or to messily mark their foes.
