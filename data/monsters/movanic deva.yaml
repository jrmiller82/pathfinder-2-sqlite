description: 'Movanic devas are stewards of the flow of good creatures'' souls through
  the cycle of life and death, from the point a creature is born to the day it dies.
  These angels arise from the souls of stalwart nurturers and protectors, and share
  a specific connection with a creature''s vital essence—its life force. Movanic devas
  are most concerned with guiding and protecting good creatures during their mortal
  lives, so once a soul has passed into the River of Souls, the movanic deva leaves
  its protection to the soul angels, or monadic devas. As part of their stewardship
  over good creatures, movanic devas can waken within animals a level of sapience
  to allow them to become kindly and benevolent as well, thus increasing the flow
  of goodness into the afterlife. They also spend time patrolling the __Positive Energy
  Plane__ and __Negative Energy Plane__, seeking to contain significant threats to
  life.
