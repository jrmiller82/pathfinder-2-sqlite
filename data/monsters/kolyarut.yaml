description: 'Kolyarut inevitables are enforcers of bargains and punishers of those
  who fail to uphold them. Their humanoid shape, ability to disguise themselves among
  a humanoid population, and diplomatic leanings make them the most approachable inevitables,
  and thus more likely to ally themselves with others. They are among the most talkative
  of all inevitables, naturally possessing a courtly grace and an encyclopedic knowledge
  of social customs, which they use to assist their efforts in gathering information
  on their targets or issuing challenges in a legal manner.
