description: 'The aquatic, wingless offspring of dragonflies are called dragonfly
  nymphs. Giant dragonfly nymphs can be several feet in length and mostly hunt in
  shallow waters, eating carrion and ambushing living creatures with their fully grown
  counterparts. They are not daunted by larger creatures, compelled by their instinct
  to eat as much as possible to sustain their growth.
