    **Triple Opportunity** A chimera gains 2 extra reactions each round that it can
    use only to make Attacks of Opportunity. It must use a different head for each
    reaction, and it can''t use more than one on the same triggering action. If it
    loses one of its heads, it also loses one of these extra reactions.

description: 'The chimera is the archetypal example of an unnatural monster made up
  of a monstrous mix of wildly different component creatures: in this case, a lion,
  a dragon, and a goat. Wild, hateful, and hungry, it tries to eat any creature it
  sees, but sometimes a strong-willed master is able to compel a chimera to serve
  as a guardian or even a mount.
