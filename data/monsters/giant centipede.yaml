description: 'Most giant centipedes (known as sewer centipedes when found in cities)
  nest in small groups but hunt alone when they seek out food. Attempts to domesticate
  giant centipedes for use as guardians or pets generally end poorly, but some tribes
  of goblins, kobolds, and mitflits have developed effective methods of utilizing
  these vermin as guardians. Other tribes and some humanoid societies roast and eat
  centipedes, often with pungent peppers as a savory delicacy, although care must
  be taken in preparing the meal to avoid tainting the flesh with the creature''s
  venom.
