description: 'Made up of thick, green vines with numerous yellow flowers, the yellow
  musk creeper grows at places where the ground is enriched with spilled blood and
  corpses, like battlefields and graveyards. An ideal environment for the yellow musk
  creeper isn''t inhabited, but draws occasional humanoid visitors the plant can transform
  into thralls. The yellow musk creeper enraptures creatures with its bright yellow
  pollen to bring them close. It then physically alters their brains with its tendrils,
  implanting a seed in each to turn the creatures into mindless thralls. The yellow
  musk creeper might try to take over a sleeping creature, but it lacks the faculties
  to sneak up on anyone, and is likely to wake victims before it can drag itself close
  enough.




  The plant''s pollen can spread far on the wind but quickly becomes too diffuse to
  cause harm. Wilderness scouts learn to sniff out the distinctive musky scent of
  the pollen, which stays potent even in harmless quantities. A sprouting creeper
  is also easy to detect, since it grows from the rotting, messy corpse of a thrall
  creature.
