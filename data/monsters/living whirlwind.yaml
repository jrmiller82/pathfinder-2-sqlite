  effect: The living whirlwind disperses. Until the end of the current turn, it can't
    be attacked or targeted, doesn't take up space, and any auras or emanations it
    has are suppressed. At the end of the turn, the living whirlwind reforms in any
    space in which it can fit within 25 feet of where it dispersed and any auras or
    emanations it has are restored as long as their duration didn't run out while
    it was dispersed.
