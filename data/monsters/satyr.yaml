  effect: The satyr plays a melody on his instrument to cast __charm__, __fear__,
    __sleep__, or __suggestion__ without expending the spell slot and using his music
    in place of providing the spell's component actions. The spell gains the __auditory__
    trait and targets all creatures in a 60-foot emanation instead of its usual targets.
    A creature that succeeds at its Will save against any spell is then temporarily
    immune from spells played from that satyr's pipes for 1 minute. Satyrs are immune
    to this music.

description: 'To a satyr, life is a party and everyone is invited. Notorious for their
  hedonism, these fey believe there''s no greater beauty than can be found in song,
  drink, indulgent meals, and carnal pleasures. Satyrs use their enchanting songs
  and natural charm to encourage all manner of people to follow their true desires
  and free themselves from society''s rules. This usually involves enticing mortals
  to join raucous parties or engage in trysts in moonlit glades. If a potential companion
  rejects a satyr''s advances, however, the satyr has little interest in continuing
  a conversation and goes off to find more amenable revelers.




  The lifestyle of a satyr leaves no room for ongoing affairs or long-term friends.
  Once his party is over or his lust is satiated, the satyr disappears back into the
  forest. The offspring satyrs leave behind are satyrs themselves, and usually end
  up being taken from their cradles by other fey rather than being left in mortals''
  care. Satyrs are always male.




  The untouched beauty of the forest is sacred and precious to a satyr. Brutish intruders
  who clear-cut trees or massacre animals without eating them risk drawing a satyr''s
  ire. A satyr so provoked uses his spells to undermine foes and attempts to dispatch
  them either with brutal ambushes or by leading a rush of forest animals to attack.




  Other fey, particularly good fey, look upon satyrs as loutish, embarrassing cousins.
  They''re rarely hostile toward satyrs, but most find them insufferable and advise
  any mortals they like to steer clear of satyrs'' glades.
