description: 'The powerful vidileths are the insidious veiled masters of the alghollthus.
  These manipulators of mind and body alike lead their species in the open, using
  their ability to change form to walk among and deceive humans and other sapient
  species. Many veiled masters are even more powerful than the typical specimen presented
  here and can use a wide range of arcane or occult spells and rituals. While veiled
  masters command significant combat prowess and impressive magical skills, the greatest
  danger they pose to others is their uncanny ability to infiltrate into societies
  much different than their own. The most paranoid of adventurers and conspiracy scholars
  worry that every major city has been infested by secret cabals of vidileths, while
  others dismiss this as hogwash and fearmongering. The truth is likely somewhere
  in between, but it doesn''t take many veiled masters pulling the strings behind
  the scenes to wreak havoc upon an entire nation!
