description: 'A creature transformed by a yellow musk creeper''s tendrils boring into
  its brain becomes a yellow musk thrall if it''s Small or Medium, or a yellow musk
  brute if Large (a Small creature becomes a Small thrall rather than a Medium one).
  The transformation takes 1 hour. A yellow musk thrall takes only the most rudimentary
  of actions: bringing the yellow musk creeper water and new creatures to infest.
  After a few days (or if the creeper dies), the thrall wanders off into the wilderness
  and falls dead within 24 hours. The body of a deceased thrall sprouts a new yellow
  musk creeper within hours of its death, becoming a fully grown plant within 24 hours.
