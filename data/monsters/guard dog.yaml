description: 'The typical guard dog is loyal to and beloved by many communities. Often
  adored as pets, they also excel as protectors and trackers, and can be fearless
  when defending a beloved master or family member. The statistics presented below
  work well for any number of breeds of dog ranging from 20 to 50 pounds in weight.
  Wild dogs can also use these statistics, but their untamed nature makes them far
  more unpredictable and threatening. Feral dogs are perhaps even more dangerous,
  for unlike their wild cousins, feral dogs often lack the instinctual fear of humanity
  that stops wild creatures from interacting with people.
