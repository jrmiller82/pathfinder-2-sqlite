description: 'Other proteans don''t consider the flying, iridescent beings known as
  voidworms to be part of a protean caste at all, but instead merely a shameful side
  effect of the Maelstrom''s constantly churning energy. To call a voidworm a protean
  in the presence of a more powerful protean is as sure a way to instigate combat
  as any.




  Voidworms themselves have little interest in whether anyone sees them as proteans.
  They maintain a thriving ecology in the Maelstrom, frolicking in schools of up to
  20 and playing in the chaos of constantly shifting realities. Elsewhere (such as
  on the Material Plane), voidworms are mesmerized by the principle of object permanence;
  many latch onto specific features of a region (such as a hillside or pond) and flit
  through the air around it for months or even years as they wait for the object of
  their curiosity to change. Minor changes— such as a tree''s change of color in the
  fall, a corpse''s slow decay, or periodic venting of steam from a geyser—all fascinate
  voidworms. A voidworm is about 2 feet long and weighs 2 pounds.
