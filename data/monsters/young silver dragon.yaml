description: 'Silver dragons are among the most chivalrous of all dragonkind; they
  wield frost and cold as weapons, can walk on clouds, and dwell high upon snowy mountain
  peaks or deep in steep, misty valleys. Although they typically make their lairs
  among the highlands, the pursuit of justice leads silver dragons to travel far and
  wideâ€”often into the very heart of realms overrun by evil. These exemplars of righteousness
  are ceaseless in their determination to help the weak, spread honor, and stamp out
  evil.




  Silver dragons are sleek and sinuous. Their hides resemble nothing so much as a
  suit of gleaming armor, lending further credence to the popular myth that silver
  dragons are the paladins of dragonkind. The zeal with which they seek out, confront,
  and defeat evil is unsurpassed even among their metallic cousins, and they adhere
  to strict codes of honor usually passed down from parent to hatchling. On occasion,
  they instead learn these codes from trusted mentors, usually other silver dragons
  or gold dragons. As they age, they become even more dedicated to their codes, often
  adding new and even more restrictive clauses to the systems that guide their behavior.




  Silver dragons are incredibly altruistic and regularly consort with the citizens
  of goodly societies, of which they consider themselves protectors and guides. In
  addition to responding to evil threats, silver dragons work to prevent evil from
  taking root in the first place, and they ensure mortals under their care are well
  fed, educated, and treated with dignity. Although silver dragons can seem overzealous
  or even eager to join the fight against evil, they know that the best way to rid
  the world of corruption is to stamp out strife and disillusionment at their source,
  not to passively sit back and watch it grow into an unsolvable problem. Silver dragons
  can be vindictive, but they can also be forgiving; for evildoers who seek to atone
  for their sins and turn over a new leaf, the support of a silver dragon is both
  unwavering and invaluable.




  Many silver dragons are also drawn to religious endeavors, venerating deities such
  as Iomedae, Sarenrae, and other deities concerned with justice, virtue, and redemption.
