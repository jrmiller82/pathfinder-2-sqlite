description: 'Boars are omnivorous mammals, hunted heavily because their meat is considered
  a delicacy. Boars are most likely to attack humanoids either in self-defense or
  during their mating season in the winter months, when the males grow an extra inch
  of tissue to protect their organs as they fight off rivals. Of course, in some cultures
  boars are trained to become much more aggressive so they can fill the roles of warbeast
  and guardian. When such boars escape back into the wild, they can become true terrors
  of the region.
