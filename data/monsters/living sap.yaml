description: 'The tall sharinga trees of the Mwangi Expanse leak golden sap from their
  swollen, bulbous trunks, which coagulates when exposed to air. The toxic resin,
  which has a bitter taste, protects the tree from herbivorous insects and other animals,
  but in rare cases—usually in areas awash in positive energy or the influence of
  the First World—the sap gains a life of its own. Such “living sap” is a mindless
  ooze that attempts to smother and engulf just about anything that moves, from the
  bugs and small beasts that feed on its sharinga tree to larger creatures unlucky
  enough to stumble upon it. Due to its immunities to most forms of physical damage
  and its protectiveness of its mother tree, a living ooze is a nuisance to communities
  that rely on the sap of sharinga trees to make resin, rubber, and glue.




  Jungle-dwelling alchemists such as __gripplis__ cherish the sap of the sharinga
  tree for its unique adhesive properties. The sap has been used for centuries to
  create tanglefoot bags, glue, and hard resin. Residue collected from a living sap
  is even more fascinating from an alchemical standpoint. Though harvesting a living
  sap is very dangerous, some alchemists will risk death (if not their own, then that
  of hearty adventurers for hire) in order to procure these easily worked ingredients.
  To increase the odds of a successful harvest, such employers are often willing to
  supply offensive aids such as lesser frost vials; living sap hunters learned long
  ago that cold energy is effective against these creatures and luckily doesn''t harm
  the harvestable reagents.
