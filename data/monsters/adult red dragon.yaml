description: 'The largest and most powerful of the chromatic dragons, red dragons
  are a menace to civilizations everywhere, and their strength is rivaled only by
  their arrogance. Red dragons see themselves as regents and overlords of all dragonkind.
  With their crowns of crimson spikes and their command of blistering frame, this
  is no haughty boast in their eyes—only unquestioned fact.




  Red dragons don''t deign to speak with lesser creatures; they simply dominate and
  burn, enslaving weaker creatures to act as servants and to look after their lairs
  while the dragons slumber away. They take pleasure in dominating these creatures,
  and they demand tribute from their supplicants. Those who anger or disappoint end
  up eaten or reduced to ash. They command their enslaved minions to constantly build
  onto their lairs, carving out new tunnels and designing cunning traps that ensure
  the dragon''s security.




  Driven by their arrogance, red dragons are the most likely of the chromatic dragons
  to ravage settlements. They want the world to see them in their rightful place as
  powerful tyrants, and they delight in threatening all other creatures. They have
  no qualms about bullying, manipulating, or killing to complete their goals—or simply
  intimidating others through a public display of brutality and dominance.




  As legendary as the brutishness of red dragons is the magnificence of their hoards
  of gold. Their lairs are often situated in dangerous places, with volcanoes being
  a favorite spot, as they find them foreboding and the constant warmth is comfortable.
  No matter the locale, red dragons sleep on a litter of coins and other treasures,
  which they zealously guard. Sometimes, the dragon''s internal heat causes these
  precious metals to fuse together.
