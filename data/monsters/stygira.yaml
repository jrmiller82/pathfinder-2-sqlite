description: 'Withered hermits wrapped in tattered rags, these scarred, eyeless creatures
  command strange secrets of the earth and interpret the fateful energies of the subterranean
  depths. In some regions, stygiras are worshipped as seers or even gods, although
  they lack the ability to grant spells to clerics and are often not aware of their
  worshippers at all. In other areas, they have strange ties to the ancient empires
  of the __cyclopes__, often dwelling in the oversized ruins those creatures left
  behind long ago. To many stygiras, gemstones harvested from ancient cyclopean mosaics
  have even greater magical properties than other crystals.




  Although technically blind, stygiras do have vestigial eyes hidden beneath the stony,
  scarred flesh of their faces. Capable of sensing bright lights even through their
  scars, stygiras are sickened and distracted by these flashing glimpses, so they
  keep to their caves during the day and wander into the world above only after nightfall.
  Far from benevolent, they seek out unwary travelers or explorers to capture and
  reduce them down to the base chemicals and supernatural humors the stygiras require
  to infuse gemstones with the capacity to give them sight and magical power.
