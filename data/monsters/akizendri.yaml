description: 'Akizendris gnaw at sources of knowledge and lore, gleefully corrupting
  and altering them to vex scholars and sages across the planes with contradictions
  and untruths. These proteans appear as cackling, serpentine creatures with elongated
  crocodilian faces, luminous eyes, and arms that vanish at the elbows into swirling
  clouds of runes before reforming into solid talons.




  Akizendris amuse themselves by rearranging or deleting texts, placing insulting
  acrostics in poetic verses, and penning crude insults upon title pages. Libraries
  in such places as __Heaven__, __Axis__, and __Hell__ are especially keen to avoid
  such contamination, knowing that their records are choice targets for every akizendri
  in existence.
