description: 'Grigs are kindly musicians of the fey, often getting themselves into
  trouble due to their penchant for confronting evil well beyond their ability to
  vanquish. Even so, they fight bravely and with great cunning, using their magic
  and ranged sonic attacks while flying and leaping using their wings and powerful
  cricket-like lower torsos to stay out of reach.
