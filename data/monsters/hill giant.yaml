description: 'Selfish and crude, these rough-skinned raiders are bullies and ultimately
  cowards. Quick-tempered and fond of violence, a hill giant gladly raids and pillages
  the defenseless but is quick to flee from those who are bigger, stronger, or better
  organized than they are. A hill giant is never above shoving or tricking one of
  their own kind to slow down their opponent or get the best loot.
