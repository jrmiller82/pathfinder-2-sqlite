description: 'While mummy guardians are undead crafted from the corpses of sacrificed—usually
  unwilling victims—and retain only fragments of their memories, a mummy pharaoh is
  the result of a deliberate embrace of undeath by a sadistic and cruel ruler. The
  transformation from life to undeath is no less awful and painful, but as the transition
  is an intentional bid to escape death by a powerful personality who fully embraces
  the blasphemous repercussions of the choice, the mummy pharaoh retains its memories
  and personality intact. Although in most cases a mummy pharaoh is formed from a
  particularly depraved ruler instructing their priests to perform complex rituals
  that grant the ruler eternal unlife, a ruler who was filled with incredible anger
  in life might spontaneously arise from death as a mummy pharaoh without undergoing
  this ritual. Depending on the nature of the ruler, a mummy pharaoh might have spellcasting
  or other class features instead of its Attack of Opportunity and disruptive abilities—the
  exact nature of the abilities the ruler had in life can significantly change or
  strengthen the mummy pharaoh presented here (which represents the least powerful
  variety of this deadly undead foe).
