description: 'Dreadsong dancers are shaped from the souls of bards, dancers, and musicians
  who pledged themselves to __Hell__ in exchange for enhanced artistic ability. Fiendish
  flesh-sculptors twist these forfeited souls so they cannot perform the art that
  drove them in life—sewing their mouths shut, mutilating their limbs, and grafting
  serrated scythe-like appendages called songblades. Devils send these warped creatures
  to torment artists who seem likely to break their infernal contracts, both to mete
  out punishment and, perversely, to give mortals a glimpse of the fate that awaits
  their damned souls.
