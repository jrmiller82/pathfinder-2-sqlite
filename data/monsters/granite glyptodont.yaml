  description: 'A blow from a granite glyptodont''s tail hardens the flesh of the
    creature struck. The target must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude saving throw or
    become __slowed 1__ (or slowed 2 on a critical failure). Further failed saves
    against calcification increase the value of the slowed condition. Once a creature''s
    actions are reduced to 0 by calcification, that creature becomes __petrified__.

    without the creature failing a save against calcification.

    save to recover. On a success, it becomes flesh again, but is slowed 1 for the
    next 24 hours. On a critical success, the creature recovers and isn''t slowed.
    On a failure, the creature remains petrified, but can try again in 24 hours. On
    a critical failure, the petrification is permanent, and the creature can''t attempt

description: 'This squat and stony creature looks like an armadillo with a large raised
  back and a flail-like tail. The granite glyptodont has no true need to feed, as
  with all elementals, yet it does seem to linger after transforming the flesh of
  those it calcifies, as if the mere proximity of flesh fossilizing into stone pleases
  it somehow.
