  description: When flipped on its back, a giant aukashungi can't move and its soft
    underbelly becomes exposed. Whenever a creature critically succeeds at a melee
    attack roll to Strike a giant aukashungi, the attacking creature can forgo the
    bonus damage to flip over the giant aukashungi (all other critical hit effects
    apply normally, such as critical specialization effects). While flipped over,
    the giant aukashungi can't use reactions, can't Stride or Strike, takes a –2 circumstance
    penalty to AC and saving throws, loses its resistances, and gains weakness 10
    to physical damage. The aukashungi can right itself by using the Roll Up activity
    and then using an action to unroll.
