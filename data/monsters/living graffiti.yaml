  description: A living graffiti can move only along flat surfaces such as floors

    to the nearest flat surface. If there is no flat surface within 5 feet, the living
    graffiti is destroyed.

description: A living graffiti is a painting or drawing that has come to life by way
  of strange magic. It typically looks like a cartoonish humanoid made of wet oil
  paint. These two-dimensional beings are unbound from the canvases on which they
  were originally drawn and can move along any flat surface they touch, including
  walls, floors, furniture, doors, and even bodies of still water. They cannot exist
  apart from the surfaces they traverse except in brief bursts, which they typically
  use to harass or attack nearby creatures. Although they are not incredibly intelligent,
  living graffiti exhibit a mischievous spitefulness and seeming desire to make the
  real world as much of a caricature as their own two-dimensional domain.
