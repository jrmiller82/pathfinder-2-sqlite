description: 'Taiga linnorms are covered in hundreds of quill-like black spines as
  sharp as spears. Wise hunters native to linnorm-infested lands know to watch for
  spines stuck in the bark of conifersâ€”a sure sign that a taiga linnorm has recently
  passed through. Sometimes this means of tracking isn''t enough to avoid an encounter,
  however; taiga linnorms, like their tarn and tor brethren, are skilled stalkers.
  They prefer to lurk in half-frozen bogs or swampy marshlands with their heads poking
  just above the water''s surface, ever watchful for unwary prey.
