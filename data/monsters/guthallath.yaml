description: 'A guthallath is an enormous construct created long ago by some unknown
  empire, probably as a war machine. Nearly 100 feet tall, this massive stone statue
  typically resembles a stalwart warrior wearing only a loincloth and skullcap. Few
  have seen the entire body of a guthallath, though; most of the time such a relic
  is buried up to its neck, covered in moss and stranded in some forgotten place.
  Yet, every so often, one of these harbingers of destruction reactivates in response
  to some unknown stimulus or rallying call, and when this happens, woe be unto any
  who stand in its way.




  While the guthallath''s ancient enemies are gone, it is an engine of pure destruction,
  designed to rampage for weeks or even months. While not intelligent enough to enjoy
  or regret its acts, the guthallath cannot be reasoned withâ€”it is unaffected by most
  magic, and is unpredictable in how it selects its targets (and creatures it spares).
