  effect: The veranallia spends a minute to encase a creature that has been dead for
    no more than a year in a cocoon. After 24 hours, the creature is restored to life,
    and the cocoon explodes in a shower of colorful blossoms. If the veranallia chooses,
    Rebirth can change the creature's ancestry or heritage, typically into an aasimar.

description: 'Veranallias represent the freedom of life to grow, change, and adapt.
  They rarely interact directly with non-azatas, as most other beings find their nature
  hard to comprehend, but those who secure their aid find them powerful allies. The
  lower half of a veranallia''s body is made of vegetation that constantly repeats
  a dizzying cycle of sprouting, blooming, thriving, and wilting. The upper half of
  their body appears as that of a humanoid of any gender—it is rare for a veranallia
  to remain consistent in their gender for more than a few seasons at a time.




  Veranallias transform the landscape in their wake, bringing creation and destruction
  alike. The world around them overflows with an abundance of vegetation, with plenty
  of food for nearby animals, and when they bring destruction, they do so without
  cruelty, as it is sometimes necessary to make room for new life. They trigger forest
  fires in woodlands before dry brush piles up to dangerous levels, and bring bitter
  winters to areas plagued with parasites that thrive in hot weather.
