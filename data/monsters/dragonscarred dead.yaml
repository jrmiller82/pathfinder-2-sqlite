description: 'Not all would-be dragonslayers who die a valiant death rest peacefully
  amid the annals of legend. Sometimes, a draconic necromancer is so impressed by
  its fallen foe that the dragon ritually raises the dead warrior to serve the dragon
  in undeath. These undead guardians are infused with a fraction of the power of the
  dragon who slew them, channeling the same energy as their draconic masters'' breath.




  Dragonscarred dead are similar to skeletal champions or graveknights in that they
  are not merely reanimated servants who mindlessly follow orders, but are instead
  powerful wardens who maintain the same agency they bore in life. While a dragonscarred
  dead is often magically compelled to follow its reanimator''s commands, some of
  these undead dragonslayers manage to escape their masters and pursue their own vile
  agendasâ€”which may involve rallying allies to challenge their draconic creator once
  more and finish the dire mission they started in life.
