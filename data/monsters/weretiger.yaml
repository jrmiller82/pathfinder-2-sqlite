description: 'These ferocious werecreatures stalk prey with the cunning and skill
  of a true apex predator. Weretigers typically view all life as a potential meal.
  Powerful nocturnal hunters with excellent senses that help them ambush prey, weretigers
  are adaptable to an extreme range of environments. However, weretigers living in
  densely populated cities (potentially as courtesans, assassins, or guild leaders)
  often struggle to suppress their killer instincts, becoming overwhelmed by the urge
  to hunt. They prefer to wear loose-fitting clothing and rely on their claws and
  jaws in a fight.
