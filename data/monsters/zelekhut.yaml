description: 'A zelekhut is a bounty hunter and executioner. The zelekhut resembles
  a mechanical centaur crafted from silvery metal with golden clockwork wings adorning
  its back. Instead of hands, the zelekhut''s arms end in long, barbed chains that
  crackle with electricity. Whether sent by the powers of Axis or summoned by mortal
  authorities, the zelekhut seeks out those who continually evade justice—either through
  active flight, or by abusing their power and station—so as to bring justice to the
  multiverse''s most notorious fugitives and criminals. Indeed, many a zelekhut''s
  quarry are as famous for their ability to evade capture as for the crimes they commit.




  Though the zelekhut is implacable and unrelenting in enforcing sentences, it does
  not pass judgments of its own or take the initiative in pursuing targets of opportunity.
  While hunting a condemned serial killer or notorious thief across half a dozen planes,
  the zelekhut wouldn''t shift a single hoof to capture a corrupt ruler whose offenses
  are far greater. All zelekhuts understand that laws can and must differ from place
  to place, and it is not the zelekhut''s job to moralize, merely to obey its rightful
  assignments and track down those who seek to flee their punishment.
