description: 'Ice golems are either carved from massive blocks of ice, or pieced together
  from individual components that are then fused together through heat and refreezing.
  In most cases, the resulting shape is little more than a crude approximation of
  a humanoid form, but given the right talent, an ice golem could be an exquisitely
  carved statue of a mythical creature, famous persona, or even a deity.




  While ice golems most frequently serve as guardians in freezing climates, the magic
  that holds an ice golem together keeps it from melting in warmer temperatures. This,
  combined with the fact that ice golems lie on the lower end of the scale as far
  as cost and difficulty to create, gives these constructs unusual features that puts
  them in great demand. The rich and powerful in hot, arid regions often commission
  ice golems not only as guardians for their estates and vaults, but for comfortâ€”the
  presence of an ice golem standing quietly sentinel in the corner of a room can help
  to keep the chamber at a comfortable temperature. The truly decadent use ice golems
  as servants to keep drinks cold.
