  description: If the giant chameleon hits a creature with a tongue Strike, that creature
    becomes __grabbed__ by the giant chameleon. The target isn't __immobilized__,
    but it can't move beyond the reach of the giant chameleon's tongue. A creature
    can sever the tongue with an attack that hits AC 15 and deals at least 4 slashing
    damage. Though this doesn't deal any damage to the giant chameleon, it prevents
    it from using its tongue Strike until it regrows its tongue, which takes a week.
