  description: 'When the worm that walks is reduced to 0 HP, it discorporates and
    the component worms that make up its body disperse in every direction. If even
    a single worm escapes, the worm that walks will eventually re-form using a process
    that typically takes 1d10 days.


    While the exact circumstances and surroundings determine how long the worm that
    walks''s foes have to dispatch the fleeing worms before they escape, usually its
    foes have only a single round. Typically, this requires the application of an
    area effect or __splash__ weapon within 1 round to the space where the worm that
    walks collapsed. After any amount of area or splash damage is dealt to that space,
    the character dealing the damage must attempt a DC 15 flat check. Each subsequent
    area or splash damage effect performed on the area reduces the DC of this flat
    check by 2, to a minimum of DC 5. If any of these flat checks succeed, none of
    the worms escape, and the worm that walks is destroyed permanently. At the GM''s
    discretion, clever means of trapping or otherwise detaining the vermin may extend
    the time allowed to finish off the worm that walks.'
