description: 'These massive, primeval relatives of ordinary slugs squirm slowly through
  swamps and grasslands. Giant slugs are always voracious and prefer to eat flesh
  or plants high in water content. They frequently consume livestock or strip bare
  entire orchards or melon crops. For cattle, pigs, or other sizable meals, they first
  shred the creatures using their radula—tongue-like appendages covered in teeth—
  to make them easier to consume. The mucus secreted by a giant slug is powerfully
  acidic and viscous. Wherever it travels, the creature leaves a trailing brown strip
  that kills most vegetation. Farmers and ranchers, especially those living near swamps
  known to contain giant slugs, keep close tabs on these journeys. Many almanacs go
  into great detail on slug migration and mating seasons. Since each giant slug needs
  its own wide hunting ground, the creatures typically come into proximity to mate
  only once a year. Either or both slugs can become impregnated, and any that do typically
  lay a clutch of around 100 eggs. They usually lay these eggs in a shallow bog or
  a cool, humid cave.




  Giant slugs tend to travel at night, as the creatures dislike sunlight and dry weather.
  They have been known to seek out locations like barns, the undersides of bridges,
  or even fortifications like castles for shelter as dawn starts to break. Woe to
  the unprepared farmer who ambles out at sunrise to milk the cows but instead finds
  that a giant slug has made the barn its home! Subterranean giant slugs don''t have
  to worry about sunlight, and crawl about on no schedule in particular. Narrow tunnels
  pose little obstacle for them, as the creatures can easily compress their bodies.
  These factors make their movements very unpredictable, so they pose quite a menace
  for underground peoples like __kobolds__ or __xulgaths__.
