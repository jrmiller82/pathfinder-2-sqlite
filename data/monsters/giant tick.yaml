  description: When the giant tick Strikes a creature larger than itself, its barbed
    hypostome attaches it to that creature. This is similar to __Grabbing__ the creature,
    but the giant tick moves with that creature rather than holding it in place. The
    giant tick is __flat-footed__ while attached. If the giant tick is killed or pushed
    away while attached to a creature on which it has used Blood Drain, that creature
    takes 1 __persistent bleed damage__. Escaping the attachment or removing the giant
    tick in other ways doesn't cause bleed damage.

  effect: The giant tick uses its hypostome to drain blood from the creature it's
    attached to. This deals 1d4 damage, and the giant tick gains temporary Hit Points
    equal to the damage dealt. A creature that has its blood drained by a giant tick
    is __drained 1__ until it receives healing (of any kind or amount).
