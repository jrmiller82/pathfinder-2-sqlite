description: 'The basidirond, also called a mindfrond, is a fungal creature that crawls
  about on woody tendrils. The large, bowl-shaped pod atop its body collects mineral-rich
  moisture—-whether runoff from cave walls or fresh blood—-for sustenance. It uses
  hallucinogenic spores to incapacitate prey long enough for it to beat its prey to
  a bloody pulp, then deposits the deliciously tenderized remains into this pod for
  consumption. A basidirond is over 6 feet tall and 3 to 4 feet wide, and weighs nearly
  300 pounds when saturated.
