description: 'Among the smallest breeds of dragon on Golarion, these savage, cunning
  hunters dwell near the oases that dot the inhospitable Narhari Desert in Vudra.
  Land-bound, they scamper across the badlands on four short limbs, their speckled
  brown and yellow bodies blending into the terrain.




  Though najra lizards live and sleep alone or in mated pairs near their hunting grounds,
  groups of up to two dozen work in unison to hunt. The lowest-ranked members of a
  najra lizard swarm leave their hidden dens to target prey with their parching spit.
  Once the unquenchable thirst caused by their venom drives the creature to the nearby
  watering hole, the entire swarm attacks. Even when unable to overwhelm foes with
  sheer numbers, najra lizards have little interest in fighting fairly. They often
  use their tails to rustle nearby desert scrub, hurl small stones, or otherwise divert
  attention so they can sneak away or attack from hiding.




  Najra lizards dislike humanoids and humanoid civilization, and they are particularly
  rankled by being called mere “lizards.” They refer to themselves by a __Draconic__
  word that translates roughly to “swarm dragon.” Like almost all dragons, najra lizards
  covet shiny metals and glittering gems. They typically hide accumulated treasures
  in small holes near where they sleep, and arguments over such caches are one of
  the few things that engender violence among members of the same pack.
