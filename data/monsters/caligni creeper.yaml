  description: When the caligni creeper dies, their body combusts in a flash of bright
    light. All creatures in a 10-foot emanation must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude
    save or be blinded for 1d6 rounds. Creatures with light blindness who successfully
    save are still blinded for 1 round. The creeper's gear and treasure are left in
    a pile where they died. As this isn't a magical effect, the light has no effect
