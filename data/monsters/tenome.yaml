description: 'A tenome resembles an eyeless humanoid with rumpled, pale skin and a
  single eye embedded in each palm of its cadaverous hands. When they opens their
  disturbingly wide mouth, this sly, frightful predator''s fangs hum and pulse with
  an eerie drone.




  Tenomes prefer to stalk urban environments; they often wear hooded cloaks or flowing
  robes to obscure their monstrous features, posing as beggars or corpses to blend
  in with society. When they attack, tenomes approach their victim with their palms
  outstretched, attempting to trap prey with their terrifying gaze. Once they seize
  their prey, tenomes vibrate their strange teeth rapidly as they feasts, emulsifying
  the bones into a digestible ooze that they slurps from a wound. Tenomes can be put
  at a disadvantage while hunting, as their vision is obscured when they have prey
  grabbed. Because of this, tenomes either wait for lone victims or hunts in packs.
  Members of these groups work together to secure meals for the entire pack and protect
  each other from being ambushed while feeding.




  There are rumors that if tenomes pluck the eyes from their victim and places one
  in each of the corpse''s palms, the slain creature will rise as a new tenome the
  next nightfall. Even tenomes aren''t sure of the truth of this rumor, as none remember
  their own origins, but they might mutilate the corpses of their victims this way
  in the hopes of creating a pack mate or to instill terror in those who discover
  the body.
