description: 'Alchemy intrigues many duergars, and their cruel traditions often motivate
  them to experiment on slaves. Eager to inflict pain and justify the abuse as a method
  of expanding knowledge, duergar bombardiers often accompany slaver bands so they
  can have the first chance to select their next test subjects from captured victims.
  To duergar bombardiers, the lob of each bomb represents a new opportunity to observe
  how their targets react and record the results to enhance future modifications to
  their alchemical concoctions.
