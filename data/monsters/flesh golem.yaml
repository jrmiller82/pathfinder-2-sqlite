description: 'Made of odd scraps of skin and muscle, a flesh golem is a grotesque
  parody of life. Though it has no mind, it can still go into a berserk rage when
  harmed, giving it a faint semblance of emotion. Flesh golems guard the laboratories
  and charnel houses of fleshwarpers and necromancers who feel no compunctions about
  desecrating corpses for their own ends. Though the first flesh golem is believed
  to have been a misguided attempt to create from simple base elements, these monstrosities
  are far from human. In isolated cases, echoes of a personality might rise in a flesh
  golem if the brain used as part of its construction belonged to a particularly powerful
  personality, but such tragic instances are (thankfully) rare in the extreme.
