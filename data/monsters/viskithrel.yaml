description: 'One of the many horrid life-forms native to __Zevgavizeb''s__ Abyssal
  realm of Gluttondark, viskithrels—or “gluttonraptors”—are tireless hunters resembling
  tentacled theropods. They are social creatures by nature and prefer to hunt in large
  packs, chasing down prey and tearing them apart to share with their fellow hunters.
  A lone viskithrel forgoes hunting to frantically seek out others of its kind, starving
  to death if it cannot do so. Although viskithrels attack nearly any other creatures
  they encounter, they virtually never fight other viskithrels; even beasts in rival
  packs give each other space rather than fight over territory or prey.




  Other, smarter denizens of Gluttondark, such as __xilvireks__  herd and train viskithrels,
  working to convince the viskithrels that the trainer is one of their pack. This
  not only protects the trainer from attacks by the viskithrels, but also enables
  the trainer to easily direct them.
