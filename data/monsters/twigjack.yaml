description: 'Maladjusted forest denizens, twigjacks form from the cruel and prankish
  combination of fey and the very woods in which they reside. A twigjack''s body is
  made up of prickly brambles woven with vines. Shaggy, mossy growth, not unlike hair,
  tops a twigjack''s head. Its mouth is just a canyon of splintered and broken sticks
  bisecting its face. Leaves and sprigs of new growth randomly sprout from the creature''s
  body. Many dense forests on Golarion have at least a handful of twigjacks living
  in the undergrowth.




  While truculent and violent, twigjacks care deeply for what they consider to be
  their forests. These creatures harass outsiders who delve deep into their wooded
  domains, forcing back even the most determined explorers, foresters, and travelers,
  especially when those intruders cut roads through the forest. However, they are
  not terribly territorial when it comes to other forest creatures. When sylvan creatures,
  especially __fey__, rally against an outside threat, twigjacks in the area eagerly
  arrive to fight, even if they were not invited.




  Less seasoned travelers who encounter twigjacks in their canopied homes often mistake
  them for __leshys__, a tendency that frustrates twigjacks, as they have a low opinion
  of such creatures. More broadly, twigjacks resent being considered mere animated
  plants at all. Rather, they embrace their fey heritage—often to a foolish end. Twigjacks
  go out of their way to ingratiate themselves to the fey creatures they live among.
  Several popular comic songs weave the tale of a twigjack attempting to woo a powerful
  and graceful __dryad__, only to be comically disgraced after many loutish attempts.
  Many fey seem embarrassed by these strange cousins, but some __spriggans__, __quicklings__,
  and __redcaps__ harness the twigjacks'' violent urges and disruptive behavior for
  their own purposes.




  While twigjacks are fey, and as such are often found in the __First World__, it''s
  somewhat curious that those twigjacks who find religion only rarely turn to the
  Eldest of the First World. Instead, twigjacks tend to worship false deities of their
  own design: figures spotted in tangles of tree branches, clots of undergrowth, or
  other hidden nooks in the natural world. These religions are always highly localized,
  and while these faiths do not support clerics, they often inspire zealous crusades
  against non-fey.
