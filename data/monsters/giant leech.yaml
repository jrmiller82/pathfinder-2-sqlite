description: 'Capable of growing to lengths of nearly 5 feet, giant leeches have circular
  maws filled with hook-like teeth. They prefer to dwell in stagnant or slow-moving
  shallow water or in damp, moist undergrowth. Horses and larger animals are their
  favorite prey, but they won''t balk at a chance to latch onto a human- or halfling-sized
  meal.
