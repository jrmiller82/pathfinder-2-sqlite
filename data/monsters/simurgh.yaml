description: 'Desert-dwelling people consider the sight of a simurgh a herald to a
  lifetime''s worth of luck, and those who are unfamiliar with the majestic beast
  might mistake it for the avatar of a deity. Beautiful, graceful, and truly gargantuan,
  the simurgh resembles nothing so much as a massive multicolored bird with the head
  of an equally enormous and regal lupine. Simurghs act as intermediaries in world-threatening
  conflicts, serving as agents of good deities or vigilantes who spread their own
  brand of justice, typically by obliterating or banishing evil extraplanar beings.




  Simurghs can live for thousands of years, and because these ancient beings are so
  rare many doubt their existence. But they are very real, as those who have been
  aided by a simurgh can enthusiastically attest. A simurgh does not show itself often,
  but when it does, it is typically in response to a truly grave threat, such as the
  incursion of an undead army or the rampage of some truly epic monster. Simurghs
  are nothing if not paragons of righteousness, and goodly heroes can hardly find
  a better ally in their quest to vanquish evil than a simurgh.
