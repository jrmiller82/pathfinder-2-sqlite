  description: Once per day, a bralani can spend 1 minute to bless willing creatures
    within 100 feet who are about to participate in a contest. This blessing lasts
    24 hours. If a blessed creature cheats or uses the contest to harm another, the
    creature grows visibly ill, becoming __sickened 1__ and unable to remove this
    condition for the duration or until they withdraw from the competition. At the
    end of the contest, participants who competed fairly find it easier to negotiate
    and understand their opponent's perspective. For 1 hour, they gain a +2 status
    bonus to __Diplomacy__ checks and __Recall Knowledge__ checks that directly pertain
    to their opponents.

description: 'Bralanis embody the freedom of fair competition, embracing opportunities
  to test their skills against worthy foes and bring mortals together with the thrill
  of good-natured sports and contests. Their interest in constructive conflict also
  extends to higher stakes, such as diplomatic negotiations. In these cases, bralanis
  ensure that neither side''s desires are crushed by the other''s and work as mediators
  when needed. They believe in friendly contests to diffuse tension. When discussions
  are going well, bralanis step back, allowing the participants to shape their own
  futures. They delight in sailing through violent storms as wind, basking in the
  raw energy.
