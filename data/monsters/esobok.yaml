  description: '**Requirement** A creature is __grabbed__ by the esobok''s jaws'
  effect: The esobok releases the target from the Grab but wrenches its spirit free
    as it does so. The creature must attempt a DC 20 Will save. Creatures without
    souls (such as most __constructs__) and creatures whose bodies and souls are one
    (such as most __celestials__, __fiends__, and __monitors__) that roll a failure
    or critical failure on the save get a success instead.
  failure: The esobok wrenches the target's soul from its body into its jaws. __Mindless__
    __undead__ creatures of level 2 or lower are destroyed, other undead creatures
    are stunned for 1 round, and all other creatures are __paralyzed__. At the end
    of each of its turns, a creature paralyzed by this effect can attempt a new save
    to end the effect. The paralysis ends automatically if the esobok attempts a jaws
    Strike or speaks.

description: 'Esoboks are brute hunters and pugnacious sentinels that serve as the
  guard dogs of the __Boneyard__. These squat, powerful quadrupeds have a frill of
  dark feathers around their distinctive heads which resemble a crocodile skull. Esoboks
  rarely bother with those who are truly dead, allowing the dead of the Boneyard to
  go about their business while remaining watchful for danger. Though cunning when
  sniffing out threats to the Boneyard or to their psychopomp handlers, they''re among
  the least intelligent of the psychopomps and rarely speak except to utter growling
  threats. The wise listen when an esobok makes a threat, as it won''t do so twice.
