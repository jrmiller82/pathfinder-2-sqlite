description: 'Few sea monsters are as dreaded and feared as the two-headed baomal.
  These massive predatory beasts typically dwell in the deepest waters and compete
  with krakens and other monsters for food. They feed on whales and other large sea
  creatures, sometimes following them to the water''s surface. Near the surface, baomals
  that encounter ships quickly learn that they contain a variety of tasty morsels.
  The creatures use their devastating spikes to rip open the ships'' hulls, then leisurely
  feed on the helpless sailors.
