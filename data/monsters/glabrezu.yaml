description: 'Glabrezus are looming behemoths who revel in the act of twisting mortal
  desires into their ultimate ruin, betraying and manipulating as easily as they breathe.
  Desires granted by a glabrezu always come to fruition in the most destructive way
  possible, turning a wish or hope into a potent and devastating act of betrayal—although
  the long-term repercussions are not always immediately apparent. For example, a
  struggling weapon smith might wish for fame and skill at their craft, only to find
  that their best patron is a cruel and sadistic murderer who uses the weapons in
  bloody sprees. Or a lonely widower might have his desire granted in the form of
  a lost love returned to “life” as a vampire. Glabrezus are nothing if not creative
  in addressing a mortal''s needs.




  These massive demons have enormous pincers and a pair of smaller humanoid arms sprouting
  from their chests, but their size belies their skill at magic, and they possess
  formidable innate spells. Treachery demons arise from the souls of mortals engaged
  in treason and deception.
