description: 'These chimeric, desert-dwelling fiends have massive bodies that are
  part hippopotamus, part large cat, and part crocodile. Though they devour souls
  for sustenance, ammuts are infamously picky eaters; most will only eat experienced
  adventurers or, for a special treat, particularly evil creatures, passing over common
  folk or those whose mettle has never been tested.




  Only a few ammuts are known to exist, and most dwell in Osirion. However, recent
  expeditions into Orv''s Vault of the Black Desert have uncovered the existence of
  ammuts in this region, as well.
