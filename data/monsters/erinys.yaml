description: 'Erinyes exact vengeance and bloody justice for a creature''s crimes,
  torturing and punishing their victims in ironic fashion before allowing them the
  escape of death. While an erinys appears as a fallen angel and the first erinyes
  shared that origin, erinyes now originate in myriad ways, some promoted from lesser
  devils and others shaped from lemures themselves forged from the souls of torturers
  and persecutors. The erinyes'' origin is entwined with Eiseth, herself a fallen
  angel and one of Hell''s most powerful demigods. The first erinyes were all considered
  to be Eiseth''s metaphorical daughters, but erinyes formed since that time are no
  longer limited to a single gender.
