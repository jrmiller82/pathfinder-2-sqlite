description: 'Hezrous dwell in the vast and endless Abyssal swamps, mires, and waterways
  and are equally at home on land and in the water. A hezrou''s presence has an obvious
  effect on nearby flora and water, causing plant life to twist and knot and infusing
  water with a foul odor and brackish taste—signs much easier to spot on the Material
  Plane than in the Abyss. Long exposure to this corruption can cause vile transformations
  and hideous mutations, and entire miserable communities of corrupted creatures sometimes
  rise in swamplands where a hezrou dwells. Hezrous themselves prefer simple pleasures,
  and they often waste their considerable intellect in the pursuit of comfortable
  places to slumber, squealing meals to eat, or objects of beauty to deface. They
  do not seek out cults to fawn over them but will not turn away those who seek to
  worship on their own. Hezrous form from the souls of those who abused and polluted
  their environs or neighbors, either through the introduction of toxins to the region
  or the insidious spread of drugs and poisons through a society.
