description: 'Though teraphants may resemble an elephant from afar, teraphants lack
  the long incisors that mark other pachyderms. Instead, tusk-like horns grow from
  their forehead. Native to Vudra, teraphants are occasionally found in Jalmeray and
  Nex, brought as rare gifts for nobles.




  These placid herbivores'' resonant psychic powers warn them against creatures approaching
  with ill intent. Faced with strong, sustained emotions, teraphants may find themselves
  responding in kind, which sometimes drive them into a fearsome rage against aggressive
  foes.
