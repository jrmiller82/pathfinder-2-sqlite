description: 'The greatest judges among the psychopomps are the massive yamarajes,
  whose wisdom is legendary and whose edicts are unappealable except to ushers or
  __Pharasma__ herself. A yamaraj resembles an immense dragon with dark, feathery
  scales and an emotionless, dispassionate gaze behind a feathered mask. When not
  serving as the senior magistrates, lords, and generals of the __Boneyard__, yamarajes
  pursue highly individualistic hobbies, such as gardening or literature. They are
  willing to halt in their duties to converse with mortals whose expertise matches
  their interests.
