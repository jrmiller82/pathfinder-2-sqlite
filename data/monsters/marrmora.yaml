description: 'On the __First World__, marrmoras dwell in ruined wildlands perpetually
  scourged by fire and rarely, if ever, travel elsewhere. When a wildfire devastates
  a wilderness region on the Material Plane and results in the death of other fey,
  marrmoras can be drawn across the planar boundary to revel in the resulting destruction.
  They seek to reignite the fires that beckoned them, to gather up and feed upon the
  charred remains of those who perished within (particularly the bodies of dead fey),
  though they do grow homesick if they spend too much time away from the First World.
  They are burdened by a capricious but persistent rage and are unfailingly cruel.
  While they are capable of negotiation and intelligent interaction, they almost never
  bargain in good faith and typically interact with others only as a means to more
  efficiently spread their fiery devastation.




  A marmorra''s twisted appearance evokes the look of an __arboreal__ whose bark has
  been burnt down to charcoal. They have nearly featureless faces and hands ending
  in long, sharp claws. Their broken flesh looks like charcoal-burnt wood, riddled
  with cracks that still glow with an unwholesome heat. They trail ash wherever they
  walk, and wisps of smoke curl off of their bodies. Though marrmoras enjoy the sight
  of any woodland and its inhabitants roasting in the flames of their carefully curated
  fires, there is little that brings more pleasure to a marrmora than the sight of
  good-aligned plant creatures cooking to a crisp.
