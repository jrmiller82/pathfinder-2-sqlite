description: 'Not all spirits who enter the __Boneyard__ realize they have died. Catrinas
  meet these souls, helping to convince them of the finality of their fate to ease
  a spirit''s passing. Catrinas are more likely to intervene when a mortal can''t
  accept their death. They perform their task to keep the afterlife calm, rather than
  out of true compassion for a mortal''s grief. Catrinas only rarely visit the Material
  Plane, typically to help an extremely important mortal pass on.




  Catrinas resemble skeletons dressed in bright flowers and colorful dresses, giving
  them a simultaneously festive and macabre appearance. Though most catrinas present
  as feminine, masculine catrinas still dress in bright colors and carry garlands
  of flowers.
