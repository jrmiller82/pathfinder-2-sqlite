  description: 'The hamadryad touches a tree within her domain of enough volume to
    contain her and merges into it for as long as she wishes. She can Cast a Spell
    while inside as long as the spell doesn''t require a line of effect outside the
    tree. She can hear, but not see, what''s going on outside the tree. She can enter
    or exit her extradimensional domain from any tree in her domain. She can Dismiss
    this effect.


    Significant physical damage dealt to the tree expels the hamadryad from the tree
    and deals 3d6 damage to her. __Passwall__ expels the hamadryad without dealing
    damage.


    If a dryad uses this ability on her bonded tree, she instead enters an extradimensional
    living space within the tree; Tree Meld gains the __extradimensional__ trait.
    A hamadryad can bring up to eight other creatures with her when entering her home
    within her bonded tree. The hamadryad can still be expelled from this space as
    above.'
