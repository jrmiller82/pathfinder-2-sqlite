description: 'Although the typical vampire bat has a wingspan of 7 inches and doesn''t
  pose a significant threat to larger prey alone (and indeed, these blood-drinkers
  can feed without their sleeping victims ever noticing), some unusually aggressive
  species of these bats hunt in deadly swarms. A churning cloud of vampire bats is
  much more dangerous than the sum of its individual parts and is capable of inflicting
  an overwhelming number of bleeding wounds in a frighteningly short span of time.
