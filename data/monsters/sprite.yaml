description: 'Common sprites are primeval guardians that latch onto a person, place,
  or object and defend it for their own inscrutable reasons. Their dispositions vary
  from kind to spiteful, but all sprites have a capricious streak. Being only about
  9 inches tall, they are wary of animals that might hunt them, particularly house
  cats, and prefer flight to a fight. On the other hand, sprites are incredibly curious
  about all forms of magic and heedlessly gather around ley line nexuses or other
  places of power.
