description: 'Blood boars are fearsome swine bred in Cheliax for the singular purpose
  of hunting down escaped slaves. The species originated from a type of large feral
  boar native to Nidal''s shadowy Uskwood, and blood boars retain their predecessors''
  gray fur, red eyes, and exceptional senses. The intensive breeding process to produce
  blood boars—augmented by the selective application of magic—grants the creatures
  an unparalleled awareness of blood, including the ability to precisely detect a
  bloodied creature''s location and movements, allowing the boars to track their prey
  from up to a mile away.




  Blood boars'' keepers groom and mark the animals to enhance their already unsettling
  appearance. While from a distance, a blood boar might be mistaken for an ordinary
  pig, up close the differences are stark. Blood-red eyes, ashen fur, and unnaturally
  sharp tusks frame hundreds of pounds of raw muscle, the veins of which can be seen
  through the boar''s ghastly pale flesh. Chains, manacles, and spikes are typical
  blood boar accessories, ensuring the boars are as fearsome as possible.




  A blood boar''s ability to track its quarry using only the scent of the target''s
  blood has been the bane of many thieves, brigands, and the occasional illicit lover,
  but none have as much cause to fear the beasts as slaves in pursuit of freedom.
  Even washing off spilled blood does nothing to deter the blood boar''s pursuit if
  it already has the scent. As a result, many halflings in the Bellflower Network
  zealously practice disarming and nonlethal combat techniques specifically to avoid
  accidental bloodshed during an escape.
