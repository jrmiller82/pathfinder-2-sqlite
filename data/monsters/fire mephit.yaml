description: 'Fire mephits are conniving and quick to anger. They aren''t evil, but
  they delight in inflicting pain, and their love of burning things pushes them the
  closest to this alignment of all mephits. They have bright-orange skin, and wisps
  of flame flicker along their wings as they flap through the air. The rivalry between
  fire and water mephits is notorious, and these creatures loathe working together
  for any amount of time.
