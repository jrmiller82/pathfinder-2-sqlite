description: 'The mightiest of archon-kind form in the heat of battle from incredibly
  uncommon circumstances. When a gathering of __lantern archons__ converges into a
  gestalt in order to defend allies in a fight that seems all but lost, a fellow archon
  of significant strength—such as a __star archon__—can commit a brave act of self-sacrifice
  by dimensionally transposing itself with the gestalt. If the circumstances are just
  right and luck is with the archons, the result is not a glorious sacrifice, but
  instead the earth-rocking emergence of a bastion archon. In this way, the lowliest
  of archons—the lanterns—can, in an instant, become their kind''s greatest hope.




  Bastion archons are massive beings made of the very stone of Heaven''s Holy Mountain,
  with their visages obscured by a blinding light surrounding the gestalt that originally
  formed the bastion. Tireless in their embodiment of the virtue of sacrifice, a bastion
  archon almost always protects the area where they manifested, and even when they
  are destroyed they leave an indelible mark of righteousness upon the surrounding
  region.
