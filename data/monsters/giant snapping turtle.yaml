description: 'If the regular-sized snapping turtle is foul-tempered, then the giant
  snapping turtle seems to be willfully violent toward anything that dares intrude
  upon its domain. Measuring over 20 feet long and weighing thousands of pounds, this
  creature is capable of swallowing a humanoid whole. Swamp-dwelling societies, particularly
  __boggards__ and __lizardfolk__, have often tried to domesticate giant snapping
  turtles to serve as powerful guardians, but in most cases the casualties pile up
  quickly. Those unfortunate enough to be swallowed whole by a giant snapping turtle
  find that even the creature''s stomach is somewhat armored, making it difficult
  to cut through.
