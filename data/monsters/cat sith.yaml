description: 'Cat siths can easily pass for common black house cats, noteworthy only
  for the white spots on their chests and their unusually bristly personalities. In
  actuality, they are cunning fey, fully capable of speech, trickery, and even walking
  upright on their hind legs and using their forepaws almost as skillfully as hands.
  Cat siths live around highland towns and cities, regularly venturing unnoticed into
  nearby communities by posing as domesticated felines or using magic to take humanoid
  form. While some cat siths gather information and undertake tasks for more powerful
  fey creatures, others serve only their own mysterious agendas.




  Cat siths are harbingers of misfortune and find amusement in the unluckiness that
  follows in their wake. Though they are rarely malicious, they are fascinated by
  death in all its forms, and may go so far as to steal the souls of the dying for
  some inscrutable purpose.
