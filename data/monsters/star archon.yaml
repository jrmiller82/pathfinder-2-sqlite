description: 'Embodiments of the virtue of prudence, star archons serve as philosophers
  and administrators, and in times of war as the tacticians, strategists, and generals
  of archon armies. Star archons burn with the glory and intensity of a sun, and their
  sense of duty and desire to defeat evil are as indefatigable as the light of the
  stars. While their dazzling intellects and unmatched strategic cunning make them
  most useful in war rooms rather than on battlefields, star archons are fierce opponents
  when motivated to enter the fray. Those who witness the self-sacrifice of a star
  archon and live to tell the tale describe the experience in terms that might befit
  the sight of a supernova at the instant the star collapses in on itself.
