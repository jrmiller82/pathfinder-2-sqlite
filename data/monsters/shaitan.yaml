description: 'Hailing from the Plane of Earth, shaitans are proud and brazen genies.
  They value physical skill and love bargaining, games of chance, and working with
  metal and stone. Immense gemstones and veins of precious metal crisscross their
  home plane, and the industrious shaitans have built a vast mercantile empire from
  these abundant natural resources.
