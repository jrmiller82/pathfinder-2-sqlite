description: 'Though many oozes hunt among the dreary confines of underground caverns,
  dungeons, and abandoned ruins, others seek to quell their hunger in areas well-trafficked
  by civilized creatures. The aptly named vaultbreaker oozes exhibit a mindless compulsion
  to feed on and digest precious metals. When near precious metals, the ichor exuded
  from their metallic plasm tarnishes black and forms small, jagged crystals that
  dot the oozes'' surface. Like a strange biological compass, these crystals point
  vaultbreaker oozes to their next meal.




  Though mindless, these strange oozes exhibit an innate instinct for picking and
  bypassing locks to reach their meals by inserting a gelatinous pseudopod into a
  keyhole and then hardening the appendage into solid metal, forming a tool similar
  to a skeleton key.




  Vaultbreaker oozes can often be found in cities where tectonic instability has created
  fissures and cracks, allowing them to infiltrate basements, vaults, and underground
  chambers that may contain treasure. When rumors of vaultbreaker ooze sightings surface,
  banker consortiums, Abadaran priests, and even local thieves guilds offer hefty
  sums to have the dangerous oozes destroyed—though some might instead offer a bounty
  for their capture.
