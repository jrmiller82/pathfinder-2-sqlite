description: Sinspawn were created by one of seven ancient wizards known collectively
  as runelordsâ€”each of whom embraced and embodied one of seven sins. The first sinspawn
  was created by the Runelord of Wrath, utilizing techniques that have since gone
  on to influence fleshwarping practices. It wasn't long before the technique used
  to create sinspawn fell into the hands of the other runelords, and while each tried
  their own hand at crafting variants of their own design, today sinspawn of wrath
  remain the most numerous and notorious of their kind. Bearing only a vague resemblance
  to the humanoids from whose flesh they were formed, sinspawn generally appear horrifically
  emaciated and have unnaturally long arms and digitigrade legs, each with a trio
  of stubby, taloned digits. Veins bulge across sinspawn's bodies in sanguine patterns
  that suspiciously resemble twisted runes, and their flesh is pale and hairless.
  Their heads are elongated, bearing only slits for a nose, red eyes, and disturbing
  lower jaws that split in half at the chin, revealing pedipalps that end in tiny,
  three-fingered hands and framing a long, lolling tongue. Sinspawn stand 6-1/2 feet
  tall and typically weigh as much as an emaciated human of their size. They behave
  in a manner consistent with their associated sin and have physical characteristics
  that hint at these qualities. For example, greedspawn's veins appear to run with
  gold while envyspawn appear even more wasted than the rest of their kin.
