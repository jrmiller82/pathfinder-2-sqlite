description: 'Those who live near elephants have learned to be wary of angering the
  beasts, but even with precautions in place, elephants sometimes still rampage. There
  is little an individual person can do when even a single elephant becomes enraged.
  Furthermore, a herd of angry or frightened elephants can easily destroy an entire
  village.
