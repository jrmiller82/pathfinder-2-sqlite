description: 'The ahuizotl is a vicious, semi-aquatic predator that resembles a hideous
  cross between a badger and an otter, with disturbingly web-fingered paws supplemented
  by a fifth hand at the end of a long, serpentine tail. A clever and stealthy hunter,
  the ahuizotl lures unwary prey to their doom by mimicking the cries of people in
  distress. The ahuizotl''s macabre habit of feeding on a victim''s eyes, fingernails,
  and teeth leaves the corpses of its kills uniquely mutilated. Some say the creatures
  consider these body parts delicacies, while others insist ahuizotls collect them
  as tribute to a powerful but unknown entity. The fact that an ahuizotl does not
  eat the actual flesh of its victims, instead depositing their savaged and waterlogged
  corpses in locations where the remains are sure to be found by friends or family,
  points to a third and perhaps more likely possibilityâ€”the ahuizotl simply enjoys
  using its violent dietary quirks to spread fear and despair.




  An ahuizotl walks on all fours, but its hands are capable of manipulating simple
  tools and other objects. Ahuizotls have roughly mustelid features and an extra membrane
  covering their eyes, giving their eyes a dull color suggestive of cataracts and
  somewhat blunting the creature''s vision. Yet despite their bestial appearance,
  ahuizotls are nearly as intelligent as the average human, and wiser than most. Although
  they don''t form societies of their own, they have been known to ally with violent
  cults or conclaves of monsters, and even to found small shrines and temples to sinister
  deities. The cult of Charon, the horseman of Death, is particularly popular among
  certain ahuizotls, who look forward to an afterlife spent wallowing in the waters
  of the River Styx.
