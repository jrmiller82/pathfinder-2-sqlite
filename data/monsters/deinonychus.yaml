description: 'Deinonychuses are wily hunters that attack in groups of up to a dozen
  individuals, ripping apart their prey with sharp talons and powerful jaws. They
  are lean and muscular, and have two powerful legs and a long tail that helps them
  maintain balance. Although deinonychuses don''t use their dexterous clawed forelimbs
  to attack, the dinosaurs can use them to pull aside small barriers. Although some
  of these dinosaurs have scaly skin, most have thatches of vibrantly colored feathers
  as well. A deinonychus is about 6 feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds.




  However, larger deinonychuses exist. These creatures—which stand taller than a human—are
  called megaraptors.
