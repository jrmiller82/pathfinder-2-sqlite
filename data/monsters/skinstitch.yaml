description: 'Skinstitches'' hulking frames are made from flayed humanoid skin stuffed
  with straw and poisonous insects. The dark god __Norgorber__ grants the secrets
  for creating these monstrosities in disturbing dreams to select followers, informally
  referred to as skinstitchers.




  While most skinstitches have vaguely humanoid shapes, they often appear monstrous
  due to various modifications their creators have made to their bodies. Some skinstitches''
  arms, for instance, may bear jagged metal blades or blunt iron rods. The most talented
  skinstitchers rarely bother with the humanoid form at all and instead opt to craft
  skinstitches that resemble other creatures sacred to Norgorber, such as scorpions,
  centipedes, or especially spiders. There are rumors of skinstitchers who can build
  skinstitches using exotic materials such as steel, __daemon__ flesh, or even magical
  shadows.




  The rotting materials used to build skinstitches tend to attract vermin, which may
  in turn make a hive or nest within the skinstitches'' bodies. Skinstitchers consider
  such occurrences as a sure sign of Norgorber''s approval.
