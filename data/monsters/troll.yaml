description: Common trolls are dim-witted, gangly giants who stalk the fringes of
  civilization. They rely on their incredible strength to overpower foes with their
  vicious claws and toothy maws. A troll's endless hunger drives it to consume all
  variety of living creatures, and it is their ravenous eating habits that fuel trolls'
  legendary regenerative abilities. Trolls stand anywhere from 12 to 16 feet tall,
  though they prefer to hunch for comfort and to lull foes into a false sense of security.
