  description: Nine lantern archons can use this activity, all within 1 round of the
    first, to merge together to form a composite being for 7 rounds that appears as
    a glowing warrior of light. The gestalt has the base statistics of a legion archon
    (AC, saving throws, attacks, skills, Speeds, and so on) but the spells and special
    abilities of a lantern archon. Additionally, it has a ranged light ray Strike
    (+18 attack, **Damage** 3d4 fire and 3d4 good), and the bonus from its Lantern
    of Hope increases to +3. When the gestalt separates, its remaining Hit Points
    are divided evenly among the lantern archons, and if the gestalt had fewer than
    9 HP, some of the lantern archons die.

description: "Friendly, curious, and eternally optimistic, lantern archons embody\
  \ the virtue of hope. They are formed of living light given corporeal shape, and\
  \ they serve as beacons, guiding mortals out of their darkest moments and toward\
  \ the path of righteousness. Their luminous bodies can \x1E icker with the subtlety\
  \ of a candle flame or flare up like a torch. Lantern archons can control all aspects\
  \ of their light as easily as other creatures control their facial expressions,\
  \ leading them to change color, twinkle, and otherwise dim and brighten in time\
  \ with their actions and words. While effervescent and chipper in conversation,\
  \ lantern archons are impressively stoic mobile support troops and guardians in\
  \ times of con\x1E ict, and are capable of uniting to form powerful warriors of\
  \ light called gestalts.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Celestial__ (__Religion__)**:\
