description: 'Kalavakuses work as slavers in the Abyss, earning them the alternate
  moniker of “slaver demons”; these fiends round up captured victims and sell them
  to other fiends or unscrupulous mortals. Pleas for freedom or clemency fall on deaf
  ears, as slaver demons consider anyone they can catch and hold to be their rightful
  property and theirs to sell. Kalavakuses know more than just physical means of restraining
  slaves; they also know how to fetter a victim''s soul. The most successful slaver
  demons have vast slave-pits in the Abyss where they keep stables of imprisoned souls.
