description: 'Polar bears are known for their pale fur, with black eyes, lips, and
  toe pads. They are aggressively predatory creatures, stalking prey for miles on
  land or across the icy waters of frozen oceans. They are also amazing ambush predators,
  leaping from the water to ambush seals resting on ice floes. If they are desperate,
  polar bears hunt not only other animals but also humanoids.
