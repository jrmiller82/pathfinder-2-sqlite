description: 'Sluglike abominations, grothluts are fleshwarps that were once humans.
  While their head and torsos are vaguely human, their arms are rubbery and move awkwardly
  at their sides. Wretched creatures, they moan piteously when other creatures are
  near, perhaps as the last remnants of their shattered human consciousness pleads
  to be free from their horrid warped form.




  Many fleshwarpers consider the grothlut to be a failure of a creation, as the transformation
  all but stamps out the human consciousness. Others disagree, arguing that warping
  the creature''s mind makes it all the more useful, since its stupidity makes it
  pliable and easy to herd. Drow typically use grothluts as guardians that slowly
  patrol the edges of their enclaves. Once in position, grothluts can be used as crude
  shock troops, unleashed to soften enemy forces before more-valuable warriors wade
  in and cut down the enemies who have been nauseated by the grothluts'' exploded
  organs and flesh.
