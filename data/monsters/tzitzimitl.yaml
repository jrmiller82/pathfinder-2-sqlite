description: 'Due to their affinity for darkness and apocalyptic terror, tzitzimitls
  are widely feared as harbingers of death and destruction. Some sages consider them
  to be instruments of the gods, called down to destroy worlds whose times have come,
  while others believe that tzitzimitls are exiles from a far-off civilization of
  spacefaring giants. The truth of their nature is likely even more disturbing.
