description: 'Dwellers of brackish coastal salt marshes and fetid bogs and swamps,
  marsh giants are hideous in appearance indeed, with fishlike mouths, slimy gray-green
  skin, and dark, beady eyes. They prefer to eat the flesh of those they slay in battle,
  but many are also cannibals. It is perhaps this vicious behavior that keeps the
  creatures in check, for if a fellow marsh giant becomes too dangerous and powerful,
  it runs the risk of being ambushed and consumed by its clan.




  Marsh giants are insular and mysterious, dedicating much of their lives to zealous
  worship of sea-dwelling deities or stranger entities. While there is no central
  religion followed by all marsh giants, many are known to venerate the demon lord
  __Dagon__, while others worship even more powerful monstrosities from the Elder
  Mythos, such as distant, dreaming Cthulhu.




  Only rarely do more than a dozen marsh giants settle together in a location, but
  when they do it is often for a religious purpose. Whatever call from the deep draws
  them together also tugs at nearby creatures such as boggards or skum, who look upon
  marsh giants in fear and reverence. The grim, terrifying chants and screams coming
  from such an encampment are a sure sign of terror to come for any other residents
  of the area.




  Barely topping 11 feet tall and 1,000 pounds, marsh giants are small for giants
  but make up for their relatively diminutive stature with their zealotry.
