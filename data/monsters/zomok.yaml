description: 'Mighty plant-dragons, zomoks prowl the woodlands, defending their homes
  from destructive forces while healing and restoring the woods following natural
  disasters and ravaging intruders. Zomoks vary in appearance with the seasons, growing
  verdant green in the spring and summer, changing to autumnal colors in the fall,
  and decaying to brown in winter. While zomoks can and often do swallow their foes,
  they have no real need to eat. Any creature they gulp down is typically left behind
  as a mangled corpse the next time the zomok travels via their Forest Step ability.
  Zomoks reach 35 to 40 feet in length and weigh 30 tons.
