description: 'No one is quite sure what lesser deaths are, though some claim that
  they are avatars of the grim reaper. Unlike that strange hunter, however, lesser
  deaths hunt in packs on rare occasions. More often than not, they manifest from
  cursed magic items. Other times, they are just the enactors of death, hunting in
  the same way the grim reaper doesâ€” silently, with neither remorse nor quarter. Rarely,
  multiple lesser deaths work together to cull a large population, their scythes cutting
  through crowds and leaving entire cities devoid of life, inspiring (hopefully) false
  rumors of multiple grim reapers.
