description: 'Balisses, or confessor angels, seek to assist mortals ensnared by moral
  dilemmas or crises of faith. Balisses prefer to guide people to their own decisions
  rather than demand obedience to a higher cause, as intrinsic belief is even more
  powerful than blind obedience. While most balisses are fundamentally honest, they
  use their guardian angel ability to seem less intimidating and decrease the chance
  the mortal will simply acquiesce to the opinion of an obviously divine being. Balisses
  often form from souls of those who performed evil acts but were redeemed. Many serve
  the goddess Sarenrae, but they can serve other good deities and empyreal lords as
  well.
