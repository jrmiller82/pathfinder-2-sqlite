description: 'The most numerous of the alghollthus are the ulat-kinis, a servitor
  race created from human stock to serve as rank-and-file soldiers in alghollthu armies.
  At the zenith of alghollthu power, ulat-kinis formed massive legions and enjoyed
  significant power over other species. When the alghollthus retreated from the world,
  they abandoned teeming hordes of ulatkinis. Although these erstwhile soldiers tried
  to continue their conquering ways, their numbers declined rapidly in battlefield
  defeats and purposeful exterminations enacted by their enemies. Ulat-kini society
  degenerated, so that now only a few enclaves exist in the depths of the earth or
  along isolated coastlines. Few remember their own species'' name, instead using
  the epithet their foes gave them: “skum.”
