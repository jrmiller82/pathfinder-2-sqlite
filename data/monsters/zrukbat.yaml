description: 'Zrukbats resemble long-limbed bats with gangly wings, which make them
  clumsy fliers. Instead, these reclusive fey prefer to crawl along surfaces using
  the hooked talons on the tips of their wings and feet. Their somewhat humanoid faces
  feature bulging black eyes, dark fur, and pointed fangs, shocking—if not terrifying—those
  who get a glimpse of them scuttling along a roof or peeping out from under an eave.
  Sensitive creatures, zrukbats quickly learn that their appearance triggers negative
  reactions, yet they prefer to live in urban settlements, observing busy streets
  and houses from inconspicuous locations.




  Zrukbats hide in plain sight using their shapeshifting abilities to mimic a broad
  repertoire of objects. Despite their intelligence, they fundamentally don''t understand
  others'' reasoning and often make foolish mistakes in their disguises. For example,
  one might shapeshift into a lit lantern in an otherwise abandoned house, misjudge
  the pattern of roof ornaments and become an out-of-place spire, or disguise themself
  as smoke in an unlit chimney.




  Due to their fearsome appearance and predisposition to conceal themselves, zrukbats
  are associated with ghosts and other supernatural phenomena. This affiliation isn''t
  wholly earned; as long as zrukbats feel they''ve gone unnoticed, they remain generally
  peaceful. When their obsessive secrecy fails, they devolve into extremely volatile,
  dangerous creatures. Once spotted, zrukbats fly into a rage if anyone utters even
  a casual suspicion regarding their presence. In areas known to harbor zrukbats,
  superstition forbids speaking aloud of curious phenomena, lest they take offense
  and attack.
