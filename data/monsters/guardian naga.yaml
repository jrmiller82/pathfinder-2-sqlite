description: 'The opposite of dark nagas in many ways, guardian nagas are benevolent
  and wise protectors of places of great natural or supernatural significance: ancient
  oak groves, forgotten holy temples, and vaults of sacred power are just a few examples
  of locations that these nagas protect. Guardian nagas believe that the beautiful
  elements of the cosmos are worthy of protection and that devotion to such a grand
  effort is its own reward. A guardian naga may join a group with similar values,
  such as a sect of priests or monks, to aid it in its holy endeavors and to exchange
  knowledge of the heavens.




  Guardian nagas usually encourage their young, upon reaching adulthood, to depart
  the nest and seek out their own natural wonders or ancient ruins to protect. Sometimes
  generations of guardian nagas might guard the same place, passing the honor of such
  care from parent to child. In such cases, the parent nagas aim to have at least
  one of their children elect to stay behind and become the guardian of their ancestral
  ward, giving the parents the peace of mind that the site they protect will continue
  to be guarded by their descendants.




  It is difficult for many societies that vilify serpents or see them as symbols of
  evil to accept the fact that guardian nagas are benevolent and kindly. Fortunately
  for these people, guardian nagas are also patient and understanding, and see encounters
  with such societies as opportunities to educate and expand worldviews.
