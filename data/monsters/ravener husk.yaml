  soul ward ever be reduced to 0 Hit Points by hunger while the ravener has more than
  1 Hit Point (see Soul Ward), they lose all traces of their former identity and descend
  into a feral, nearly mindless state. Even if a ravener husk later consumes soul
  energy, the transformation can be reversed only via Ravenous Repast.
