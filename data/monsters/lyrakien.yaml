description: 'Lyrakiens are musical messengers and embodiments of free travel. They
  serve __Desna__ and other deities and empyreal lords of __Elysium__, but are quite
  fond of the concept of free time and are always on the hunt for opportunities to
  pause in their duties to enjoy music or appreciate a moment of beauty. They love
  contests, stories, and songs, and they often challenge mortals to musical contests
  or pester them to share grand tales of their exploits. Lyrakiens rely on their agility
  to avoid conflicts, but they do their best to defend places of great natural beauty,
  especially against lawful or evil foes they can damage with their starlight. Lyrakiens
  have an innate wanderlust and rarely stay in the same place for very long. Some
  travel alongside adventurers, ofter writing songs about their quests and feats of
  derring-do.




  Though light-hearted creatures, lyrakiens don''t let their whimsical personalities
  get in the way of protecting breathtaking natural locations. Often called “glistenwings”
  by __gnomes__ and __halflings__, they are frequently mistaken for __sprites__ or
  similar fey, a bit of confusion that many lyrakiens find amusing and fertile ground
  for shenanigans involving those they deem deserving of a bit of unexpected fun and
  discord in their lives.
