description: 'Quetzalcoatlus are the largest flying members of the pterosaur family
  and are often mistaken for dragons due to their immense size and 40-foot wingspans.


  Quetzalcoatlus are carnivorous, feeding on a variety of reptiles, mammals, large
  fish, amphibians, and other invertebrates. They are not inherently aggressive creatures
  and are happy to scavenge for food, but when presented with live prey they readily
  attack almost any creature smaller than themselves.
