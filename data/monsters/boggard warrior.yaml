    becomes __grabbed__ by the boggard. Unlike with a normal grab, the creature isn't
    __immobilized__, but it can't move beyond the reach of the boggard's tongue. A
    creature can sever the tongue by hitting AC 15 and dealing at least 3 slashing
    damage. Though this doesn't deal any damage to the boggard, it prevents it from
    using its tongue Strike until it regrows its tongue, which takes a week.
