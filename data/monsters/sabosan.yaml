description: "Sabosans are evil, intelligent, bat-like humanoids who live in warm\
  \ forests and drink the blood of other creatures, particularly people. They have\
  \ thin, emaciated torsos and broad, leathery wings that can reach a span of almost\
  \ 20 feet. Sabosans' heads, necks, shoulders, and upper chests are covered with\
  \ red or dark-brown fur that barely obscures their stretched.thin flesh. Their ears\
  \ are large and pointed like a bat\x81fs, and indeed they can echolocate to locate\
  \ prey much like bats can, though their eyes are also capable of seeing in low light.\n\
  \n\n\nSome believe that sabosans are distant descendants of humans who were afflicted\
  \ with vampirism but managed to avoid succumbing to undeath. Others posit they were\
  \ once a tribe of demon worshippers whose dark rites transformed them into their\
  \ current forms. No matter their true origins, sabosans have infamous reputations\
  \ among residents of towns and cities south of the equator. Even mere rumors of\
  \ sabosans in an area are enough to set off city-wide hunts, and the truly superstitious\
  \ aren\x81ft above setting fires near every grotto, nook, and foxhole they come\
  \ across in order to smoke out the nocturnal creatures.\n\n\n\nSabosans hunt during\
  \ the twilight hours or just after dark, when their echolocation gives them a predatory\
  \ edge over their sleeping prey. They are capable hunters but indiscriminating when\
  \ it comes to food sources; their rapid metabolisms means sabosans must eat nearly\
  \ 20 pounds of meat and fruit per day (supplemented, naturally, with copious amounts\
  \ of blood).\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Humanoid__ (__Society__)**: DC 20"
