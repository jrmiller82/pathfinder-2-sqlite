description: 'Stone golems are slow and steady constructs typically carved from marble
  or granite. They''re often made to serve as works of art when at rest, so some golem
  crafters employ master sculptors to ensure the constructs make beautiful statues.
  Older stone golems might be weathered, with scuffed or cracked surfaces or missing
  noses and digits, but this weathering is largely cosmetic and doesn''t adversely
  impact the golems'' functionality.




  Tales tell of particularly immense stone golems residing in certain ancient ruins.
  Survivors from time-lost civilizations bent on carrying out orders from long-gone
  masters, these immense stone golems are much more powerful than most stone golems.
  They are always level 15 or higher and never smaller than Huge in sizeâ€”most are
  Gargantuan. Because their size is so great and the structures they dwell in so dilapidated,
  the awakening of such a stone golem can cause surrounding structures to collapse,
  ancient foundations to buckle, and ceilings to come crashing down on foes. In addition
  to the statistics here, these massive stone golems attack with wide, sweeping strikes
  capable of knocking down multiple targets at once.
