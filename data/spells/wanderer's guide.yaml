descr: You call upon the beyond to guide your route. When you Cast this Spell, choose
  a destination; you receive an inspired route to that destination, allowing you and
  allies who travel overland with you to reduce the movement penalty from difficult
  terrain by half for the duration, as long as you don't deviate from the inspired
  route. This doesn't have any effect on movement during encounters. If you use this
  ability again before the duration is over, this effect ends and is replaced by that
  of the new route.
duration: until your next daily preparations
