descr: "You unleash a beam of divine energy. Choose an alignment your deity has (chaotic,\
  \ evil, good, or lawful). You can't cast this spell if you don't have a deity or\
  \ if your deity is true neutral. Make a ranged spell attack roll against the target's\
  \ AC. On a hit, the target takes damage of the chosen alignment type equal to 1d4\
  \ + your spellcasting ability modifier (double damage on a critical hit). The spell\
  \ gains the trait of the alignment you chose.  \n\n**Heightened (+1)**  The damage\
  \ increases by 1d4."
