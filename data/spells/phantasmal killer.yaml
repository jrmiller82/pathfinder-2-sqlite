descr: "You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to\
  \ the target. Only the spell's target can see the killer, though you can see the\
  \ vague shape of the illusion as it races forth to attack. The effect of the killer\
  \ is based on the outcome of the target's Will save.  \n\n**Critical Success** \
  \ The target is unaffected.  \n\n**Success**  The target takes 4d6 mental damage\
  \ and is frightened 1.  \n\n**Failure**  The target takes 8d6 mental damage and\
  \ is frightened 2.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  The target is so afraid it might die.\
  \ It must attempt a Fortitude save; if the target fails, it dies. On a successful\
  \ Fortitude save, the target takes 12d6 mental damage, is fleeing until the end\
  \ of its next turn, and is frightened 4. This effect has the incapacitation trait.\
  \  \n\n---\n**Heightened (+1)**  The damage increases by 2d6 on a failure and by\
  \ 3d6 on a critical failure."
