descr: "The ground within the area transforms into a mass of dangerous briars that\
  \ assault and impede your foes. Each round when you Sustain the Spell, you can select\
  \ one of the following effects to occur in the area. \n\n* **Ensnare** The briars\
  \ clump around your foes, attempting to hold them in place. A foe within the area\
  \ (or flying at most 20 feet above the area) must attempt a Reflex save. On a failure,\
  \ it takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to all Speeds for 1 round, and on a critical\
  \ failure, it is immobilized for 1 round unless it Escapes. \n\n* **Impede** The\
  \ briars twist and writhe, making the entire area difficult terrain. \n\n* **Wall**\
  \ A *wall of thorns* appears in the area, lasting for 1 round. The wall is greater\
  \ difficult terrain instead of difficult terrain. \n\nIn addition, once per round\
  \ you can direct the briars to impale any target in the area (or flying up to 20\
  \ feet above the area) that you can see by using a single action, which has the\
  \ concentrate and manipulate traits. Make a spell attack roll. On a success, the\
  \ target takes 10d6 piercing damage and takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to\
  \ all Speeds for 1 round; on a critical success, the target is immobilized for 1\
  \ round unless it Escapes."
