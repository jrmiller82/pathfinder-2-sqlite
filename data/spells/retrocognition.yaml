descr: "Opening your mind to occult echoes, you gain impressions from past events\
  \ that occurred in your current location. Retrocognition reveals psychic impressions\
  \ from events that occurred over the course of the last day throughout the first\
  \ minute of the duration, followed by impressions from the next day back the next\
  \ minute, and so on. These echoes don't play out like a vision but instead reveal\
  \ impressions of emotions and metaphors that provide cryptic clues and details of\
  \ the past. If you witness a traumatic or turbulent event through an impression,\
  \ the spell ends unless you succeed at a Will save with a DC of at least 30 and\
  \ possibly as much as 50, depending on the severity of the event. The GM determines\
  \ whether an event is traumatic and chooses the DC.  \n\n**Heightened (8th)**  You\
  \ gain impressions of events that occurred over the previous year for each minute\
  \ you concentrate, instead of the previous day, though the details diminish, making\
  \ it harder to distinguish impressions from all but the most major events.  \n\n\
  **Heightened (9th)**  You gain impressions of events that occurred over the previous\
  \ century for each minute you concentrate, instead of the previous day, though the\
  \ details diminish, making it almost impossible to distinguish impressions from\
  \ all but the most major events."
