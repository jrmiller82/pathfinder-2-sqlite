descr: You transform into a Large tree. Perception checks don't reveal your true nature,
  but a successful Nature or Survival check against your spell DC reveals that you
  appear to be a tree that is strangely new to the area. While in tree form, you can
  observe everything around you, but you can't act other than to end the spell, and
  your turn, by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait. As a tree,
  your AC is 20, and only status bonuses, status penalties, circumstance bonuses,
  and circumstance penalties affect you. Any successes and critical successes you
  roll on Reflex saves are failures.
