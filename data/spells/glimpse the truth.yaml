- Somatic
descr: "Divine insight lets you see things as they truly are. The GM attempts a secret\
  \ counteract check against each illusion that is at least partially within the area.\
  \ Instead of counteracting the illusion, you see through it (for instance, if the\
  \ check succeeds against an *illusory disguise* spell, you see the creature's true\
  \ form but *illusory disguise* doesn't end). \n\nThe area moves with you for the\
  \ duration of the spell, and the GM attempts a secret counteract check each time\
  \ a new illusion is within the area.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (7th)**  You can allow\
  \ everyone to see through illusions you succeed against, not just yourself."
