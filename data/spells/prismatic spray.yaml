descr: 'A spray of rainbow light beams cascades from your open hand. Each creature
  in the area must roll 1d8 on the table below to see which beam affects it, then
  attempt a saving throw of the indicated type. The table notes any additional traits
  that apply to each type of ray. If a creature is struck by multiple beams, it uses
  the same d20 result for all its saving throws. For all rays, a successful saving
  throw negates the effect for that creature.Prismatic Spray 1d8ColorSaveEffects (Traits)
