descr: "A spray of rainbow light beams cascades from your open hand. Each creature\
  \ in the area must roll 1d8 on the table below to see which beam affects it, then\
  \ attempt a saving throw of the indicated type. The table notes any additional traits\
  \ that apply to each type of ray. If a creature is struck by multiple beams, it\
  \ uses the same d20 result for all its saving throws. For all rays, a successful\
  \ saving throw negates the effect for that creature.\n\n| 1d8 | Color | Save | Effects\
