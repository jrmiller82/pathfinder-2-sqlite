descr: "You mouth words quietly, but instead of coming out of your mouth, they're\
  \ transferred directly to the ears of the target. While others can't hear your words\
  \ any better than if you normally mouthed them, the target can hear your words as\
  \ if they were standing next to you. The target can give a brief response as a reaction,\
  \ or as a free action on their next turn if they wish, but they must be able to\
  \ see you and be within range to do so. If they respond, their response is delivered\
  \ directly to your ear, just like the original message.  \n\n**Heightened (3rd)**\
  \  The spell's range increases to 500 feet."
