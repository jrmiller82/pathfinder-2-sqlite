descr: "You fire a green ray at your target. Make a spell attack. You deal 12d10 damage,\
  \ and the target must attempt a basic Fortitude save. On a critical hit, treat the\
  \ save result as one degree worse. A creature reduced to 0 HP is reduced to fine\
  \ powder; its gear remains. \n\nAn object you hit is destroyed (no save), regardless\
  \ of Hardness, unless it's an artifact or similarly hard to destroy. A single casting\
  \ can destroy no more than a 10-foot cube of matter. This automatically destroys\
  \ any force construct, such as a wall of force.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (+1)**  The\
  \ damage increases by 2d10."
