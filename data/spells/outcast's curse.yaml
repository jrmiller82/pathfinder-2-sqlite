descr: "You afflict the target with a curse that makes its presence abrasive and off\
  \ -putting. The target must attempt a Will save.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The\
  \ target is unaffected.  \n\n**Success**  For 10 minutes, the target must roll twice\
  \ and use the worse result whenever attempting a Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation,\
  \ or Performance check, and creatures they encounter have an initial attitude toward\
  \ them of one step worse (for instance, unfriendly instead of indifferent).  \n\n\
  **Failure**  As success, but the effect is permanent.  \n\n**Critical Failure**\
  \  As failure, and creatures that the target encounters have an initial attitude\
  \ toward them of two steps worse."
