descr: You mime creating an invisible 10-foot-by-10-foot stretch of wall adjacent
  to you and within your reach. The wall is solid to those creatures that don't disbelieve
  it, even incorporeal creatures. You and your allies can voluntarily believe the
  wall exists to continue to treat it as solid, for instance to climb onto it. A creature
  that disbelieves the illusion is temporarily immune to your house of imaginary walls
  for 1 minute. The wall doesn't block creatures that didn't see your visual performance,
  nor does it block objects. The wall has AC 10, Hardness equal to double the spell's
  level, and HP equal to quadruple the spell's level.
