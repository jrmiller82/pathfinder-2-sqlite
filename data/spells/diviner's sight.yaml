descr: You glimpse into the target's future. Roll a d20; when the target attempts
  a non-secret saving throw or skill check, it can use the number you rolled instead
  of rolling, and the spell ends. Alternatively, you can instead reveal the result
  of the die roll for one of the target's secret checks during the duration, and the
  spell ends. Casting it again ends any active diviner's sight you have cast, as well
  as any active diviner's sight on the target.
duration: until the end of your next turn
