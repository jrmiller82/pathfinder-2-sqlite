descr: "This spell grants perfect sight based on scrying, allowing several willing\
  \ targets to track the exact movements or position of one creature or object. Choose\
  \ one target creature or object in the area to be tracked. It becomes the sensor\
  \ for the spell. Up to five willing creatures of your choice in the area can see\
  \ a ghostly image of this creature or object when it's out of their sight. They\
  \ can perceive the creature or object perfectly, allowing them to ignore the concealed\
  \ or invisible condition, though physical barriers still provide cover. The tracking\
  \ creatures can see the tracked creature or object through all barriers other than\
  \ lead or running water, which block their vision. Distance doesn't matter, though\
  \ the creature or object might move so far away it becomes too small to perceive.\
  \ The tracking creatures don't see any of the environment around the target, though\
  \ they do see any gear a creature is wearing or holding, and they can tell if it\
  \ removes objects from its person. If the target to be tracked is willing, the duration\
  \ is 1 hour. If you try to track an unwilling creature, the target must attempt\
  \ a Will save.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The creature or object is unaffected.\
  \  \n\n**Success**  As described, and the duration is 1 minute.  \n\n**Failure**\
  \  As described, and the duration is 1 hour."
