descr: "You repel all magic from the target area, preventing spells and other magic\
  \ from functioning. Spells can't penetrate the area, magic items cease to function\
  \ within it, and no one inside can cast spells or use magic abilities. Likewise,\
  \ spells- such as *dispel magic*-can't affect the field itself unless they are of\
  \ a higher level. Magic effects resume the moment they pass outside the field. For\
  \ example, a ray fired from one side of the field could target a creature on the\
  \ other side (as long as caster and target are both outside the field). A summoned\
  \ creature winks out of existence but reappears if the field moves or ends. Invested\
  \ magic items cease to function, but they remain invested and resume functioning\
  \ when they exit the field; the ability boost from an apex item isn't suppressed\
  \ within the field. Spells of a higher level than the antimagic field overcome its\
  \ effects, and can even be cast by a creature within the field. \n\nThe field disrupts\
  \ only magic, so a *+3 longsword* still functions as a longsword. Magically created\
  \ creatures (such as golems) function normally within an *antimagic field*."
