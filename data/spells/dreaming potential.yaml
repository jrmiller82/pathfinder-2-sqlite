components:
- Material
- Somatic
- Verbal
descr: You draw the target into a lucid dream where it can explore the endless possibilities
  of its own potential within the ever-changing backdrop of its dreamscape. If it
  sleeps the full 8 hours uninterrupted, when it wakes, it counts as having spent
  a day of downtime retraining, though it can't use dreaming potential for any retraining
  that would require either an instructor or specialized knowledge it can't access
  within the dream.
