descr: "You request a direct intercession from the natural world. Nature always refuses\
  \ unnatural requests and might grant a different request (potentially more powerful\
  \ or better fitting its character) than the one you asked for. A primal phenomenon\
  \ spell can do any of the following things. Duplicate any primal spell of 9th level\
  \ or lower. Duplicate any non-primal spell of 7th level or lower. Produce any effect\
  \ whose power level is in line with the above effects. Reverse certain effects that\
  \ refer to the wish spell. At the GM's discretion, you can try to use primal phenomenon\
  \ to produce greater effects than these, but doing so may be dangerous, or the spell\
  \ may have only a partial effect.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t"
