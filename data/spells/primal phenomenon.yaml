descr: "You request a direct intercession from the natural world. Nature always refuses\
  \ unnatural requests and might grant a different request (potentially more powerful\
  \ or better fitting its character) than the one you asked for. A *primal phenomenon*\
  \ spell can do any of the following things. \n\n* Duplicate any primal spell of\
  \ 9th level or lower. \n* Duplicate any non-primal spell of 7th level or lower.\
  \ \n* Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects. \n\
  * Reverse certain effects that refer to the wish spell. \n\nAt the GM's discretion,\
  \ you can try to use *primal phenomenon* to produce greater effects than these,\
  \ but doing so may be dangerous, or the spell may have only a partial effect.\n\n\
