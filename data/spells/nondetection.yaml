descr: You erect protective wards that make the target difficult to detect via magic.
  *Nondetection* attempts to counteract all detection, revelation, and scrying divinations
  made against the target or the target's gear throughout the duration, counting cantrips
  as 1st-level spells for this purpose. Successfully counteracting a divination that
  targets an area or multiple targets negates the effects only for *nondetection*'s
  target.
