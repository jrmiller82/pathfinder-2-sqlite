descr: "You transform the target to make it match your artisanal and artistic vision.\
  \ If you have expert proficiency in Crafting, the item grants a +1 item bonus to\
  \ attack rolls if it's a weapon or skill checks if it's a skill tool. The target\
  \ is a beautiful and impressive piece for its new quality, but the effect is obviously\
  \ temporary, so its monetary value doesn't change. \n\nWhen you cast this spell,\
  \ any previous *artistic flourish* you had cast ends.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (7th)**\
  \  If you have master proficiency in Crafting, the item grants a +2 item bonus instead.\
  \  \n\n**Heightened (10th)**  If you have legendary proficiency in Crafting, the\
  \ item grants a +3 item bonus instead."
