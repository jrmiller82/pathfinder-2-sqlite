descr: You unravel the magic behind a spell or effect. Attempt a counteract check
  against the target (page 458). If you succeed against a spell effect, you counteract
  it. If you succeed against a magic item, the item becomes a mundane item of its
  type for 10 minutes. This doesn't change the item's non-magical properties. If the
  target is an artifact or similar item, you automatically fail.
