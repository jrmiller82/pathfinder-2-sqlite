descr: You unravel the magic behind a spell or effect. Attempt a counteract check
  against the target. If you succeed against a spell effect, you counteract it. If
  you succeed against a magic item, the item becomes a mundane item of its type for
  10 minutes. This doesn't change the item's non-magical properties. If the target
  is an artifact or similar item, you automatically fail.
