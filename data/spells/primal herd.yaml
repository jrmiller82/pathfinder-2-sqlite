descr: "Summoning the power of the natural world, you transform the targets into a\
  \ herd of mammoths, and they each assume a Huge battle form. Each target must have\
  \ enough space to expand into or the spell fails for that target. Each target gains\
  \ the animal trait. Each target can Dismiss the spell's effects on themself. Each\
  \ target gains the following while transformed:  \n\n * AC = 22 + the target's level.\
  \ Ignore any armor check penalty and Speed reduction.\n\n * 20 temporary Hit Points.\n\
  \n * Speed 40 feet.\n\n * Low-light vision.\n\n * The following unarmed melee attacks,\
  \ which are the only attacks the target can use. They're trained with them. When\
  \ attacking with these attacks, the target uses their attack modifier with the proficiency\
  \ and item bonuses of their most favorable weapon or unarmed Strike, and the damage\
  \ is listed for each attack. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of\
  \ the enfeebled condition, for example). If the target's unarmed attack modifier\
  \ is higher, they can use it instead. **Melee** |1| tusk (reach 15 feet), **Damage**\
  \ 4d8+19 piercing; **Melee** |1| trunk (agile, reach 15 feet), **Damage** 4d6+16\
  \ bludgeoning; **Melee** |1| foot (agile, reach 15 feet), **Damage** 4d6+13 bludgeoning.\n\
  \n * Athletics modifier of +30, unless the target's own modifier is higher.\n\n\
  \ * **Trample** |3| You move up to twice your Speed and move through the space of\
  \ Large or smaller creatures, trampling each creature whose space you enter. A trampled\
  \ creature takes damage from its foot Strike based on a basic Reflex save (DC =\
  \ 19 + the target's level)."
