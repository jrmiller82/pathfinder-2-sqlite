descr: "You conjure a towering mansion up to four stories tall and up to 300 feet\
  \ on a side. While Casting the Spell, you hold an image of the mansion and its desired\
  \ appearance in your mind. The mansion can contain as many or as few rooms as you\
  \ desire, and it is decorated as you imagine it. You can imagine a purpose for each\
  \ room of the mansion, and the proper accouterments appear within. Any furniture\
  \ or other mundane fixtures function normally for anyone inside the mansion, but\
  \ they cease to exist if taken beyond its walls. No fixture created with this spell\
  \ can create magical effects, but magical devices brought into the mansion function\
  \ normally. \n\nYour mansion contains the same types and quantities of foodstuffs\
  \ and servants as created by the *magnificent mansion* spell. \n\nEach of the mansion's\
  \ exterior doorways and windows are protected by *alarm* spells. You choose whether\
  \ each alarm is audible or mental as you Cast the Spell, and each has a different\
  \ sound (for an audible alarm) or sensation (for a mental one), allowing you to\
  \ instantly determine which portal has been used."
