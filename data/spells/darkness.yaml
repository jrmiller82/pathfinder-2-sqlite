descr: "You create a shroud of darkness that prevents light from penetrating or emanating\
  \ within the area. Light does not enter the area and any non-magical light sources,\
  \ such as a torch or lantern, do not emanate any light while inside the area, even\
  \ if their light radius would extend beyond the darkness. This also suppresses magical\
  \ light of your darkness spell's level or lower. Light can't pass through, so creatures\
  \ in the area can't see outside. From outside, it appears as a globe of pure darkness.\
  \  \n\n**Heightened (4th)**  Even creatures with darkvision (but not greater darkvision)\
  \ can barely see through the darkness. They treat targets seen through the darkness\
  \ as concealed."
