descr: "The target appears to fall down dead, though it actually turns invisible.\
  \ Its illusory corpse remains where it fell, complete with a believable fatal wound.\
  \ This illusion looks and feels like a dead body. If the target's death seems absurd-for\
  \ instance, a barbarian at full health appears to be slain by 2 damage-the GM can\
  \ grant the attacker an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the illusion. If\
  \ the target uses hostile actions, the spell ends. This ends the entire spell, so\
  \ the illusory corpse disappears too.  \n\n**Heightened (7th)**  The spell doesn't\
  \ end if the target uses hostile actions."
