descr: "You form a spiritual link with another creature, allowing you to take in its\
  \ pain. When you Cast this Spell and at the start of each of your turns, if the\
  \ target is below maximum Hit Points, it regains 2 Hit Points (or the difference\
  \ between its current and maximum Hit Points, if that's lower). You lose as many\
  \ Hit Points as the target regained. This is a spiritual transfer, so no effects\
  \ apply that would increase the Hit Points the target regains or decrease the Hit\
  \ Points you lose. This transfer also ignores any temporary Hit Points you or the\
  \ target have. Since this effect doesn't involve positive or negative energy, spirit\
  \ link works even if you or the target is undead. While the duration persists, you\
  \ gain no benefit from regeneration or fast healing. You can Dismiss this spell,\
  \ and if you're ever at 0 Hit Points, spirit link ends automatically.  \n\n**Heightened\
  \ (+1)**  The number of Hit Points transferred each time increases by 2."
