descr: "Your litany rails against the sin of wrath, punishing the target for attacking\
  \ good creatures. The target must attempt a Will save. A particularly wrathful creature,\
  \ such as a wrath demon, uses the outcome one degree of success worse than the result\
  \ of its saving throw. The target then becomes temporarily immune to all of your\
  \ litanies for 1 minute.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The target is unaffected.  \n\
  \n**Success**  The first time the target uses an action that deals damage to at\
  \ least one good creature, the target takes 3d6 good damage.  \n\n**Failure**  Each\
  \ time the target uses an action that deals damage to at least one good creature,\
  \ the target takes 3d6 good damage.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  The target is enfeebled\
  \ 2. Each time it uses an action that deals damage to at least one good creature,\
  \ the target takes 3d6 good damage.  \n\n**Heightened (+1)**  The damage increases\
  \ by 1d6."
