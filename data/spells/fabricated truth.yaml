descr: "Choose a single statement you want the targets to believe. The fact could\
  \ be narrow, such as \"a dragon is circling overhead and wants to kill me\"; wide-reaching,\
  \ such as \"all humanoids are disguised abominations\"; or conceptual, such as \"\
  if I don't live a kinder life, I'll be punished in the afterlife.\" The targets'\
  \ experiences color how they react to this \"truth\" and how their behavior changes.\
  \ If the statement changes what they perceive, they treat the change as a sudden\
  \ revelation. \n\nThe effect of the spell depends on the targets' Will saves. If\
  \ a target is already subject to *fabricated truth*, your spell tries to counteract\
  \ it. If the counteract check fails, the outcome of the target's saving throw can't\
  \ be worse than a success.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The target doesn't believe\
  \ the statement, and it knows you tried to trick it.  \n\n**Success**  The target\
  \ doesn't believe the statement or realize you tried to trick it.  \n\n**Failure**\
  \  The target believes the statement for a duration of 1 week.  \n\n**Critical Failure**\
  \  The target believes the statement with unlimited duration."
