descr: "You project an illusory image of yourself. You must stay within range of the\
  \ image, and if at any point you can't see the image, the spell ends. Whenever you\
  \ Cast a Spell other than one whose area is an emanation, you can cause the spell\
  \ effect to originate from either yourself or the image. Because the image is an\
  \ illusion, it can't benefit from spells, though visual manifestations of the spell\
  \ appear. The image has the same AC and saves as you. If it is hit by an attack\
  \ or fails a save, the spell ends.  \n\n**Heightened (+2)**  The maximum duration\
  \ you can Sustain the Spell increases to 10 minutes."
