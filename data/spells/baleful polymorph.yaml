descr: "You transform the target creature into a harmless animal appropriate to the\
  \ area, with effects based on its Fortitude save.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The\
  \ target is unaffected.  \n\n**Success**  The target's body gains minor features\
  \ of the harmless animal. Its insides churn as they partially transform, causing\
  \ it to be sickened 1. When it recovers from the sickened condition, its features\
  \ revert to normal.  \n\n**Failure**  The target transforms for 1 minute but keeps\
  \ its mind. If it spends all its actions on its turn concentrating on its original\
  \ form, it can attempt a Will save to end the effect immediately.  \n\n**Critical\
  \ Failure**  The target is transformed into the chosen harmless animal, body and\
  \ mind, for an unlimited duration."
