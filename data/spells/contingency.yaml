descr: "You prepare a spell that will trigger later. While casting contingency, you\
  \ also cast another spell of 4th level or lower with a casting time of no more than\
  \ 3 actions. This companion spell must be one that can affect you. You must make\
  \ any decisions for the spell when you cast *contingency*, such as choosing a damage\
  \ type for *resist energy*. During the casting, choose a trigger under which the\
  \ spell will be cast, using the same restrictions as for the trigger of a Ready\
  \ action. Once contingency is cast, you can cause the companion spell to come into\
  \ effect as a reaction with that trigger. It affects only you, even if it would\
  \ affect more creatures. If you define complicated conditions, as determined by\
  \ the GM, the trigger might fail. If you cast *contingency* again, the newer casting\
  \ supersedes the older.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (8th)**  You can choose a spell of\
  \ 5th level or lower.  \n\n**Heightened (9th)**  You can choose a spell of 6th level\
  \ or lower.  \n\n**Heightened (10th)**  You can choose a spell of 7th level or lower."
