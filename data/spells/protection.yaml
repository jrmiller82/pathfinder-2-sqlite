descr: You ward a creature against a specified alignment. Choose chaotic, evil, good,
  or lawful when you cast this spell. The target gains a +1 status bonus to Armor
  Class and saving throws against creatures and effects of the chosen alignment. This
  bonus increases to +3 against effects from such creatures that would directly control
  the target and against attacks made by summoned creatures of the chosen alignment.
  This spell gains the trait that opposes the alignment you chose-if you choose chaos,
  this spell gains the lawful trait, and vice versa; if you choose evil, this spell
  gains the good trait, and vice versa.
