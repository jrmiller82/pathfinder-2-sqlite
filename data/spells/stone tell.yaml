descr: You can ask questions of and receive answers from natural or worked stone.
  While stone is not intelligent, you speak with the natural spirits of the stone,
  which have a personality colored by the type of stone, as well as by the type of
  structure the stone is part of, for worked stone. A stone's perspective, perception,
  and knowledge give it a worldview different enough from a human's that it doesn't
  consider the same details important. Stones can mostly answer questions about creatures
  that touched them in the past and what is concealed beneath or behind them.
