descr: "You unleash a wave of necromantic energy to snuff out the life force of those\
  \ in its path. Each creature of 17th level or lower in the line must attempt a Fortitude\
  \ save. If the damage from massacre reduces a creature to 0 Hit Points, that creature\
  \ dies instantly. If massacre doesn't kill even a single creature, the negative\
  \ energy violently explodes back toward you, dealing an additional 30 negative damage\
  \ to every creature in the line (even those above 17th level) and 30 negative damage\
  \ to you.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The creature is unaffected.  \n\n**Success**\
  \  The creature takes 9d6 negative damage.  \n\n**Failure**  The creature takes\
  \ 100 negative damage.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  The creature dies.  \n\n**Heightened\
  \ (10th)**  The spell can affect creatures up to 19th level. Increase the damage\
  \ to 10d6 on a success, and to 115 on a failure."
