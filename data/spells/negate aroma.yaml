descr: "The target loses its odor, preventing creatures from passively noticing its\
  \ presence via smell alone, even if the creatures have precise or imprecise scent.\
  \ A creature attempting a Perception check to Seek with scent and other senses might\
  \ notice the lack of natural scent. If the target has any abilities that result\
  \ from its smell, such as an overpowering scent, those abilities are also negated.\
  \  \n\n---\n**Heightened (5th)**  The range increases to 30 feet, and you can target\
  \ up to 10 creatures."
