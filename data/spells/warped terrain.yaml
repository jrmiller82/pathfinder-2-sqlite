components:
- Somatic

descr: "You create illusory hazards that cover all surfaces in the area (typically\
  \ the ground). Any creature moving through the illusion treats the squares as difficult\
  \ terrain. A creature can attempt to disbelieve the effect as normal after using\
  \ a Seek action or otherwise spending actions interacting with the illusion. If\
  \ it successfully disbelieves, it ignores the effect for the remaining duration.\
  \ For each additional action you use casting the spell, the burst's radius increases\
  \ by 5 feet, to a maximum of 10 extra feet for 3 actions.  \n\n**Heightened (4th)**\
  \  You can make the illusion appear in the air rather than on a surface, causing\
  \ it to function as difficult terrain for flying creatures."
