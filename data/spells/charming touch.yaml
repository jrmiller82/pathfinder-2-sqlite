descr: "You infuse your target with attraction, causing it to act friendlier toward\
  \ you. The target attempts a Will save. It gains a +4 circumstance bonus to this\
  \ save if you or your allies recently threatened or were hostile to it. \n\n**Critical\
  \ Success**  The target is unaffected and aware you tried to charm it.  \n\n**Success**\
  \  The target is unaffected but thinks your spell was something harmless instead\
  \ of *charming touch*, unless it identifies the spell (See Identifying Magic). \
  \ \n\n**Failure**  The target's attitude becomes friendly toward you. If it was\
  \ friendly, it becomes helpful. It can't use hostile actions against you.  \n\n\
  **Critical Failure**  The target is helpful and can't use hostile actions against\
  \ you.  \n\nYou can Dismiss the spell. If you use hostile actions against the target,\
  \ the spell ends. After the spell ends, the target doesn't necessarily realize it\
  \ was charmed unless its friendship with you or the actions you convinced it to\
  \ take clash with its expectations, which could potentially allow you to convince\
  \ the target to continue being your friend via mundane means.  \n\n---\n**Heightened\
  \ (4th)**  You can target any type of creature, not just humanoids, as long as it\
  \ could find you attractive."
