descr: "Drawing life force into yourself, you become a beacon of positive energy.\
  \ You glow with bright light in a 10-foot emanation, and you gain an internal pool\
  \ of light called a luminance reservoir, which begins with a value of 4. At the\
  \ start of each of your turns, you can use a free action to increase the luminance\
  \ reservoir by 4. If you do, the radius of your light increases by 10 feet. If an\
  \ undead creature damages you with an attack or spell while it's within the area\
  \ of your light, that creature takes positive damage equal to half your luminance\
  \ reservoir value. It takes this damage only the first time it damages you in a\
  \ round. You can Dismiss this Spell. When you do, you can target a creature within\
  \ your light and direct the positive energy into it. The target must be a willing\
  \ living creature or an undead creature. This heals a living target or damages an\
  \ undead target by an amount equal to your luminance reservoir's value. When you\
  \ cast positive luminance, any other positive luminance spell you already had in\
  \ effect ends.  \n\n**Heightened (+1)**  Both the initial value of your luminance\
  \ reservoir and the amount you gain each turn increase by 1."
