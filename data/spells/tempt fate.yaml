descr: "You twist the forces of fate to make a moment dire or uneventful, with no\
  \ in-between. The target gains a +1 status bonus to the triggering saving throw.\
  \ If the saving throw's result is a success, it becomes a critical success. If it's\
  \ a failure, it becomes a critical failure, and the critical failure can't be reduced\
  \ by abilities that usually reduce critical failure, such as improved evasion. \n\
  \nIf the triggering ability did not have both a critical success and critical failure\
  \ condition, *tempt fate* fails, but you don't expend the Focus Point for Casting\
  \ this Spell.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (8th)**  The bonus on the saving throw is +2."
