descr: "You conjure a fiend to fight on your behalf. This works like *summon animal*,\
  \ except you summon a common creature that has the fiend trait and whose level is\
  \ 5 or lower. You can't summon a creature unless its alignment is one of your deity's\
  \ preferred alignments (or, if you don't have a deity, is within one step of your\
  \ alignment). At the GM's discretion, some deities might restrict specific types\
  \ of fiends, even if their alignments match.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (6th)**  Level\
