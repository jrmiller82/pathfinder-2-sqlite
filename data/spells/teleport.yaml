descr: "You and the targets are instantly transported to any location within range,\
  \ as long as you can identify the location precisely both by its position relative\
  \ to your starting position and by its appearance (or other identifying features).\
  \ Incorrect knowledge of the location's appearance usually causes the spell to fail,\
  \ but it could instead lead to teleporting to an unwanted location or some other\
  \ unusual mishap determined by the GM. *Teleport* is not precise over great distances.\
  \ The targets appear at a distance from the intended destination equal to roughly\
  \ 1 percent of the total distance traveled, in a direction determined by the GM.\
  \ For short journeys, this lack of precision is irrelevant, but for long distances\
  \ this could be up to 1 mile.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (7th)**  You and the other\
  \ targets can travel to any location within 1,000 miles.  \n\n**Heightened (8th)**\
  \  You and the other targets can travel to any location on the same planet. If you\
  \ travel more than 1,000 miles, you arrive only 10 miles off target.  \n\n**Heightened\
  \ (9th)**  You and the other targets can travel to any location on another planet\
  \ within the same solar system. Assuming you have accurate knowledge of the location's\
  \ position and appearance, you arrive on the new planet 100 miles off target.  \n\
  \n**Heightened (10th)**  As the 9th-level version, but you and the other targets\
  \ can travel to any planet within the same galaxy."
