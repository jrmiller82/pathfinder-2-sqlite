descr: "Four acorns grow in your hand, their shells streaked with pulsing red and\
  \ orange patterns. You or anyone else who has one of the acorns can toss it up to\
  \ 30 feet with an Interact action. It explodes in a 5-foot burst, dealing 4d6 fire\
  \ damage. The save uses your spell DC, even if someone else throws the acorn. Flames\
  \ continue to burn on the ground in the burst for 1 minute, dealing 2d6 fire damage\
  \ to any creature that enters the flames or ends its turn within them. A creature\
  \ can take damage from the continuing flames only once per round, even if it's in\
  \ overlapping areas of fire created by different acorns. When the spell ends, any\
  \ remaining acorns rot and turn to ordinary soil.  \n\n**Heightened (8th)**  The\
  \ burst's damage increases to 5d6, and the continuing flames damage increases to\
  \ 3d6.  \n\n**Heightened (9th)**  The burst's damage increases to 6d6, and the continuing\
  \ flames damage increases to 3d6."
