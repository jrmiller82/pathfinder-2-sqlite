descr: "Vitality radiates outward from you, allowing others to supplicate and receive\
  \ healing. Once per round, either you or an ally can use an Interact action to supplicate\
  \ and lay hands upon you to regain Hit Points. Each time the beacon heals someone,\
  \ it decreases in strength. It restores 4d10 Hit Points to the first creature, 4d8\
  \ Hit Points to the second, 4d6 Hit Points to the third, and 4d4 Hit Points to the\
  \ fourth, after which the spell ends. You can have only one *vital beacon* active\
  \ at a time.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (+1)**  The beacon restores one additional die\
  \ of Hit Points each time it heals, using the same die size as the others for that\
  \ step."
