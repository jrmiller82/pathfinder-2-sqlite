components:
- Material
descr: "Your deity blesses base metals to transform them into precious materials.\
  \ The target item transforms from its normal metal into cold iron, copper, gold,\
  \ iron, silver, or steel. An item transmuted in this way deals damage according\
  \ to its new material. For example, a steel sword transmuted to cold iron would\
  \ deal additional damage to a creature with a weakness to cold iron. \n\nThis change\
  \ is clearly magical and temporary, so the item's monetary value doesn't change;\
  \ you couldn't transmute copper coins to gold and use those coins to purchase something\
  \ or as a cost for a spell.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (8th)**  Add adamantine and mithral\
  \ to the list of metals you can transform the item into."
