descr: "Your deity blesses base metals to transform them into precious materials.\
  \ The target item transforms from its normal metal into cold iron, copper, gold,\
  \ iron, silver, or steel (the details for these metals are found on pages 577-579).\
  \ An item transmuted in this way deals damage according to its new material. For\
  \ example, a steel sword transmuted to cold iron would deal additional damage to\
  \ a creature with a weakness to cold iron. This change is clearly magical and temporary,\
  \ so the item's monetary value doesn't change; you couldn't transmute copper coins\
  \ to gold and use those coins to purchase something or as a cost for a spell.  \n\
  \n**Heightened (8th)**  Add adamantine (page 578) and mithral (page 579) to the\
  \ list of metals you can transform the item into."
