descr: You delve into the possible futures of the next few seconds to understand all
  the ways your target might avoid harm, then cast out a vision of that future to
  those around you. On the first attack roll made against the target during *true
  target*'s duration, the attacker rolls twice and uses the better result. The attacker
  also ignores circumstance penalties to the attack roll and any flat check required
  due to the target being concealed or hidden.
