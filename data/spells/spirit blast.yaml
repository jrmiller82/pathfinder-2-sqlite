descr: "You concentrate ethereal energy and attack a creature's spirit, dealing 16d6\
  \ force damage. Because spirit blast affects the creature's spirit, it can damage\
  \ a target projecting its consciousness (such as via project image) or possessing\
  \ another creature even if the target's body is elsewhere. The possessed creature\
  \ isn't harmed by the blast. The blast doesn't harm creatures that have no spirit,\
  \ such as constructs.  \n\n**Heightened (+1)**  The damage increases by 2d6."
