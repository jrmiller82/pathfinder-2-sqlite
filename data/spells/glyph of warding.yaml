descr: You craft a trap by binding a hostile spell into a symbol. While Casting this
  Spell, you also Cast a Spell of a lower spell level to store in the glyph. The stored
  spell must take 3 actions or fewer to cast, have a hostile effect, and target one
  creature or have an area. You can set a password, a trigger, or both for the glyph.
  Any creature that moves, opens, or touches the target container or enters the target
  area that doesn't speak the password or that matches the trigger activates the glyph,
  releasing the harmful spell within. Once a spell is stored in the glyph, the glyph
  gains all the traits of that spell. If the stored spell targets one or more creatures,
  it targets the creature that set off the glyph. If it has an area, that area is
  centered on the creature that set off the glyph. Glyph of warding's duration ends
  when the glyph is triggered. The glyph counts as a magical trap, using your spell
  DC for both the Perception check to notice it and the Thievery check to disable
  it; both checks require the creature attempting them to be trained in order to succeed.
  You can Dismiss glyph of warding. The maximum number of glyphs of warding you can
  have active at a time is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.
