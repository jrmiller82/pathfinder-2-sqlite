descr: "A feral aspect overcomes the targets, making them tough and savage. Targets\
  \ gain 5 temporary Hit Points, a +10-foot status bonus to their Speeds, and weakness\
  \ 5 to silver. They also grow vicious fangs and claws, which are unarmed attacks.\
  \ The fangs deal 2d8 piercing damage; the claws deal 2d6 slashing damage and have\
  \ the agile and finesse traits. The targets use their highest weapon or unarmed\
  \ attack proficiency with these attacks, and if they have weapon specialization\
  \ or greater weapon specialization, they add this damage as well. On a critical\
  \ hit with one of these unarmed attacks, the creature struck takes 1d4 persistent\
  \ bleed damage.\n\nThe targets can't use concentrate actions unless those actions\
  \ also have the rage trait, with the exception of Seek. A creature can attempt to\
  \ end the spell's effect on itself by using a single action, which has the rage\
  \ trait, to attempt a Will save against your spell DC; on a success, it ends the\
  \ spell's effect on itself. \n\nIf a target is in the light of a full moon, it also\
  \ grows by one size if it were Medium or smaller. This increases the reach of a\
  \ Medium or Tiny creature by 5 feet.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (6th)**  The temporary\
  \ Hit Points increase to 10, the silver weakness to 10, and the damage dealt by\
  \ the attacks to three dice.  \n\n**Heightened (10th)**  The temporary Hit Points\
  \ increase to 20, the silver weakness to 20, and the damage dealt by the attacks\
  \ to four dice."
