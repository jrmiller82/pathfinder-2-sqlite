descr: Divine power wards the targets, granting each a +1 status bonus to AC and saves
  while in the area. Choose an alignment your deity has (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful).
  You can't cast this spell if you don't have a deity or your deity is true neutral.
  This spell gains the trait of the alignment you chose. The bonuses granted by the
  spell increase to +2 against attacks by-and effects created by-creatures with an
  alignment opposite to the spell (lawful if you chose chaotic, evil if you chose
  good). These bonuses increase to +4 against effects created by such creatures that
  attempt to impose the controlled condition on a target of your divine aura, as well
  as against attacks made by creatures summoned by anything opposite in alignment
  to your divine aura. When a creature of opposite alignment hits a target with a
  melee attack, the creature must succeed at a Will save or be blinded for 1 minute.
  It's then temporarily immune for 1 minute. The first time you Sustain the Spell
  each round, the divine aura's radius grows 10 feet.
