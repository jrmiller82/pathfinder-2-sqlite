descr: "You travel to the Ethereal Plane, which overlaps the Material Plane. Material\
  \ Plane creatures can't see you, and you can move through things on the Material\
  \ Plane. You move at half your normal Speeds, but can move in any direction (including\
  \ up and down). \n\nYou can see onto the Material Plane within a radius of 60 feet;\
  \ it is gray, hazy, and concealed from you. You can't affect the Material Plane,\
  \ and you can't be affected by the Material Plane except by force effects and abjurations\
  \ originating there. \n\nWhen the spell ends, you return to the Material Plane.\
  \ If you're in the air, you fall (unless you can fly), and if you're inside an object,\
  \ you're pushed into the nearest open space and take 1d6 damage per 5 feet you were\
  \ pushed.\n\nIf you cast this spell when not on the Material Plane, it is lost.\
  \  \n\n---\n**Heightened (9th)**  You can target up to five additional willing creatures\
  \ at a range of 30 feet. The duration is up to 10 minutes."
