descr: "You create a barrier of gusting winds that hinders anything moving through\
  \ it. The wall of swirling winds is 5 feet thick, 60 feet long, and 30 feet high.\
  \ The wall stands vertically, but you can shape its path. Though the wall of wind\
  \ distorts the air, it does not hamper sight. The wall has the following effects.\
  \ \n\n* Ammunition from physical ranged attacks-such as arrows, bolts, sling bullets,\
  \ and other objects of similar size-can't pass through the wall. Attacks with bigger\
  \ ranged weapons, such as javelins, take a -2 circumstance penalty to their attack\
  \ rolls if their paths pass through the wall. Massive ranged weapons and spell effects\
  \ that don't create physical objects pass through the wall with no penalty. \n\n\
  * The wall is difficult terrain to creatures attempting to move overland through\
  \ it. Gases, including creatures in gaseous form, can't pass through the wall. \n\
  \n* A creature that attempts to fly through the wall using a move action must attempt\
  \ a Fortitude save.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The creature can move through the\
  \ wall normally this turn.  \n\n**Success**  The flying creature can move through\
  \ the wall this turn, but the wall is difficult terrain.  \n\n**Failure**  The wall\
  \ stops the movement of the flying creature, and any remaining movement from its\
  \ current action is wasted.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  As failure, and the creature\
  \ is pushed 10 feet away from the wall."
