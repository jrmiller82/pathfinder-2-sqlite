  \ form. You must have enough space to expand into or the spell is lost. When you\
  \ cast this spell, choose phoenix, purple worm, or sea serpent. While in this form,\
  \ you gain the beast trait (for phoenix) or the animal trait (for purple worm or\
  \ sea serpent). You can Dismiss the spell. You gain the following statistics and\
  \ abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:  \n\n * AC = 20 + your level.\
  \ Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.\n\n * 20 temporary Hit\
  \ Points.\n\n * Darkvision.\n\n * One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to\
  \ the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can use. You're trained\
  \ with them. Your attack modifier is +28, and you use the listed damage. These attacks\
  \ are Strength based (for the purpose of the enfeebled condition, for example).\
