descr: "Your litany rails against the sin of sloth, interfering with the target's\
  \ ability to react. The target must attempt a Will save. A particularly slothful\
  \ creature, such as a sloth demon, uses the outcome one degree of success worse\
  \ than the result of its saving throw. The target becomes temporarily immune to\
  \ all of your litanies for 1 minute.  \n\n **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\
  \  \n\n **Success** The target can't use reactions.  \n\n **Failure** The target\
  \ can't use reactions and is slowed 1.  \n\n **Critical Failure** The target can't\
  \ use reactions and is slowed 2."
