descr: "You call down four meteors that explode in a fiery blast. Each meteor deals\
  \ 6d10 bludgeoning damage to any creatures in the 10-foot burst at the center of\
  \ its area of effect before exploding, dealing 14d6 fire damage to any creatures\
  \ in its 40-foot burst. The meteors' central 10-foot bursts can't overlap, and a\
  \ creature takes the same amount of fire damage no matter how many overlapping explosions\
  \ it's caught in. The saving throw applies to both the bludgeoning and the fire\
  \ damage.  \n\n**Heightened (+1)**  The bludgeoning damage increases by 1d10, and\
  \ the fire damage increases by 2d6."
