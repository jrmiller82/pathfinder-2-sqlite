descr: "You step into a living tree with a trunk big enough for you to fit inside\
  \ it and instantly teleport to any tree of the same species within 5 miles that\
  \ also has a sufficiently large trunk. Once you enter the first tree, you instantly\
  \ know the rough locations of other sufficiently large trees of the same species\
  \ within range and can exit from the original tree, if you prefer. You can't carry\
  \ extradimensional spaces with you; if you attempt to do so, the spell fails.  \n\
  \n---\n**Heightened (6th)**  The tree you exit can be up to 50 miles away.  \n\n\
  **Heightened (8th)**  The tree you exit can be up to 500 miles away.  \n\n**Heightened\
  \ (9th)**  The tree you exit can be anywhere on the same planet."
