  \ you, run away (as if it had the fleeing condition), release what it's holding,\
  \ drop prone, or stand in place. It can't Delay or take any reactions until it has\
  \ obeyed your command. The effects depend on the target's Will save.  \n\n**Success**\

  \ turn, the creature must use a single action to do as you command.  \n\n**Critical\
