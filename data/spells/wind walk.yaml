descr: When you cast this spell, each target transforms into a vaguely cloud-like
  form and is picked up by a wind moving in the direction of your choice. You can
  change the wind's direction by using a single action, which has the concentrate
  trait. The wind carries the targets at a Speed of 20 miles per hour, but if any
  of the targets make an attack, Cast a Spell, come under attack, or otherwise enter
  encounter mode, the spell ends for all targets just after they roll initiative,
  and they drift gently to the ground.
