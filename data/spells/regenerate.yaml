descr: "An infusion of positive energy grants a creature continuous healing. The target\
  \ temporarily gains regeneration 15, which restores 15 Hit Points to it at the start\
  \ of each of its turns. While it has regeneration, the target can't die from damage\
  \ and its dying value can't exceed 3, though if its wounded value becomes 4 or higher,\
  \ it stays unconscious until its wounds are treated. If the target takes acid or\
  \ fire damage, its regeneration deactivates until after the end of its next turn.\
  \ Each time the creature regains Hit Points from regeneration, it also regrows one\
  \ damaged or ruined organ (if any). During the spell's duration, the creature can\
  \ also reattach severed body parts by spending an Interact action to hold the body\
  \ part to the area it was severed from.  \n\n**Heightened (9th)**  The regeneration\
  \ increases to 20."
