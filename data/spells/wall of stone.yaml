descr: "You shape a wall of solid stone. You create a 1-inch-thick wall of stone up\
  \ to 120 feet long, and 20 feet high. You can shape the wall's path, placing each\
  \ 5 feet of the wall on the border between squares. The wall doesn't need to stand\
  \ vertically, so you can use it to form a bridge or set of stairs, for example.\
  \ You must conjure the wall in an unbroken open space so its edges don't pass through\
  \ any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost. \n\nEach 5-foot-by-5-foot section\
  \ of the wall has AC 10, Hardness 14, and 50 Hit Points, and it's immune to critical\
  \ hits and precision damage. A destroyed section of the wall can be moved through,\
  \ but the rubble created from it is difficult terrain.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (+2)**\
  \  The Hit Points of each section of the wall increase by 15."
