descr: "You harness your mastery of primal forces to reshape your body into a Medium\
  \ flying animal battle form. When you cast this spell, choose bat, bird, pterosaur,\
  \ or wasp. You can decide the specific type of animal (such as an owl or eagle for\
  \ bird), but this has no effect on the form's Size or statistics. While in this\
  \ form, you gain the animal trait. You can Dismiss the spell. <br><br>You gain the\
  \ following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:\
  \  \n\n * AC = 18 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.\n\
  \n * 5 temporary Hit Points.\n\n * Low-light vision.\n\n * One or more unarmed melee\
  \ attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you\
  \ can use. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +16, and your damage\
  \ bonus is +5. These attacks are Dexterity based (for the purpose of the clumsy\
  \ condition, for example). If your attack modifier for Dexterity-based unarmed attacks\
  \ is higher, you can use it instead.\n\n * Acrobatics modifier of +16, unless your\
  \ own modifier is higher.\n\n  \n\nYou also gain specific abilities based on the\
  \ form you choose:  \n\n * **Bat** Speed 20 feet, fly Speed 30 feet; precise echolocation\
  \ 40 feet; **Melee** |1| fangs, **Damage** 2d8 piercing; **Melee** |1| wing (agile),\
  \ **Damage** 2d6 bludgeoning.\n\n * **Bird** Speed 10 feet, fly Speed 50 feet; **Melee**\
  \ |1| beak, **Damage** 2d8 piercing; **Melee** |1| talon (agile), **Damage** 1d10\
  \ slashing.\n\n * **Pterosaur** Speed 10 feet, fly Speed 40 feet; imprecise scent\
  \ 30 feet; **Melee** |1| beak, **Damage** 3d6 piercing.\n\n * **Wasp** Speed 20\
  \ feet, fly Speed 40 feet; **Melee** |1| stinger, **Damage** 1d8 piercing plus 1d6\
  \ persistent poison.\n\n---\n**Heightened (5th)**  Your battle form is Large and\
  \ your fly Speed gains a +10-foot status bonus. You must have enough space to expand\
  \ into or the spell is lost. You instead gain 10 temporary HP, attack modifier +18,\
  \ damage bonus +8, and Acrobatics +20.  \n\n**Heightened (6th)**  Your battle form\
  \ is Huge, your fly Speed gains a +15-foot status bonus, and your attacks have 10-foot\
  \ reach. You must have enough space to expand into or the spell is lost. You instead\
  \ gain AC = 21 + your level, 15 temporary HP, attack modifier +21, damage bonus\
  \ +4 and double damage dice (including persistent damage), and Acrobatics +23."
