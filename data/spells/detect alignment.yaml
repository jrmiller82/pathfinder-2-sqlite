descr: "Your eyes glow as you sense aligned auras. Choose chaotic, evil, good, or\
  \ lawful. You detect auras of that alignment. You receive no information beyond\
  \ presence or absence. You can choose not to detect creatures or effects you're\
  \ aware have that alignment. Only creatures of 6th level or higher-unless divine\
  \ spellcasters, undead, or beings from the Outer Sphere-have alignment auras.  \n\
  \n---\n**Heightened (2nd)**  You learn each aura's location and strength.\n\n\n\
  ## Alignment Aura\nThe strength of an alignment aura depends on the level of the\
  \ creature, item, or spell. The auras of undead, clerics and other divine spellcasters\
  \ with a patron deity, and creatures from the Outer Sphere are one step stronger\
  \ than normal (faint instead of none, for example).\n\n| Creature or Item Level\
  \ | Spell or Effect Level | Aura Strength |\n| :----------------------: | :--------------------:\
  \ | :-------------: |\n| 0-5 | - | None |\n| 6-10 | 0-3 | Faint |\n| 11-15 | 4-7\
  \ | Moderate |\n| 16-20 | 8-9 | Powerful | \n| 21+ | 10 | Overwhelming |"
