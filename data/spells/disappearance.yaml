descr: You shroud a creature from others' senses. The target becomes undetected, not
  just to sight but to all senses, allowing the target to count as invisible no matter
  what precise and imprecise senses an observer might have. It's still possible for
  a creature to find the target by Seeking, looking for disturbed dust, hearing gaps
  in the sound spectrum, or finding some other way to discover the presence of an
  otherwise-undetectable creature.
