descr: "You shoot an utterly cold ray of darkness tinged with unholy energy. Make\
  \ a ranged spell attack against the target. You deal 5d6 cold damage, plus 5d6 evil\
  \ damage if the target is a celestial. If the ray passes through an area of magical\
  \ light or targets a creature affected by magical light, *chilling darkness* attempts\
  \ to counteract the light. If you need to determine whether the ray passes through\
  \ an area of light, draw a line between yourself and the spell's target.  \n\n**Critical\
  \ Success**  The target takes double damage.  \n\n**Success**  The target takes\
  \ full damage.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (+1)**  The cold damage increases by 2d6,\
  \ and the evil damage against celestials increases by 2d6."
