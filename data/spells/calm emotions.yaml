descr: "You forcibly calm creatures in the area, soothing them into a nonviolent state;\
  \ each creature must attempt a Will save.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The creature\
  \ is unaffected.  \n\n**Success**  Calming urges impose a -1 status penalty to the\
  \ creature's attack rolls.  \n\n**Failure**  Any emotion effects that would affect\
  \ the creature are suppressed and the creature can't use hostile actions. If the\
  \ target is subject to hostility from any other creature, it ceases to be affected\
  \ by calm emotions.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  As failure, but hostility doesn't\
  \ end the effect."
