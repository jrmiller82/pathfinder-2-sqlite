descr: "You harmlessly place your unique magical sigil, which is about 1 square inch\
  \ in size, on the targeted creature or object. The mark can be visible or invisible,\
  \ and you can change it from one state to another by using an Interact action to\
  \ touch the target. The mark can be scrubbed or scraped off with 5 minutes of work.\
  \ If it's on a creature, it fades naturally over the course of a week. The time\
  \ before the mark fades increases depending on your heightened level.  \n\n**Heightened\
  \ (3rd)**  The sigil instead fades after 1 month.  \n\n**Heightened (5th)**  The\
  \ sigil instead fades after 1 year.  \n\n**Heightened (7th)**  The sigil never fades."
