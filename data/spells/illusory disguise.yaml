descr: "You create an illusion that causes you to appear as another creature of the\
  \ same body shape, and with roughly similar height (within 6 inches) and weight\
  \ (within 50 pounds), as yourself. The disguise is typically good enough to hide\
  \ your identity, but not to impersonate a specific individual. The spell doesn't\
  \ change your voice, scent, or mannerisms. You can change the appearance of your\
  \ clothing and worn items, such as making your armor look like a dress. Held items\
  \ are unaffected, and any worn item you remove returns to its true appearance. \n\
  \nCasting *illusory disguise* counts as setting up a disguise for the Impersonate\
  \ use of Deception; it ignores any circumstance penalties you might take for disguising\
  \ yourself as a dissimilar creature, it gives you a +4 status bonus to Deception\
  \ checks to prevent others from seeing through your disguise, and you add your level\
  \ even if you're untrained. You can Dismiss this spell.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (2nd)**\
  \  The spell also disguises your voice and scent, and it gains the auditory trait.\
  \  \n\n**Heightened (3rd)**  You can appear as any creature of the same size, even\
  \ a specific individual. You must have seen an individual to take on their appearance.\
  \ The spell also disguises your voice and scent, and it gains the auditory trait."
