descr: "Each creature in the area becomes drowsy and might fall asleep. A creature\
  \ that falls unconscious from this spell doesn't fall prone or release what it's\
  \ holding. This spell doesn't prevent creatures from waking up due to a successful\
  \ Perception check, limiting its utility in combat.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The\
  \ creature is unaffected.  \n\n**Success**  The creature takes a -1 status penalty\
  \ to Perception checks for 1 round.  \n\n**Failure**  The creature falls unconscious.\
  \ If it's still unconscious after 1 minute, it wakes up automatically.  \n\n**Critical\
  \ Failure**  The creature falls unconscious. If it's still unconscious after 1 hour,\
  \ it wakes up automatically.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (4th)**  The creatures fall\
  \ unconscious for 1 round on a failure or 1 minute on a critical failure. They fall\
  \ prone and release what they're holding, and they can't attempt Perception checks\
  \ to wake up. When the duration ends, the creature is sleeping normally instead\
  \ of automatically waking up."
