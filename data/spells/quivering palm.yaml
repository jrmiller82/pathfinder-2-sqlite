  \ the duration, you can spend a single action, which has the auditory and concentrate\
  \ traits, to speak a word of death that could instantly slay it. The target must\
  \ attempt a Fortitude save.If you cast quivering palm again, the effects of any\
  \ quivering palm you had previously cast end.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The target\
  \ survives, the spell ends, and the target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.\
  \  \n\n**Success**  The target is stunned 1 and takes 40 damage, the spell ends,\
  \ and the target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.  \n\n**Failure**  The\
  \ target is stunned 3 and takes 80 damage. The spell's duration continues, but the\
  \ target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours against being killed by quivering\
  \ palm.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  The target dies.  \n\n**Heightened (+1)**  The\
  \ damage increases by 10 on a failure, or 5 on a success."
