  \ spells treat the creature as undead and heal spells treat the creature as living.\
  \ In addition, harm spells gain a +2 status bonus to the Hit Points restored to\
  \ the target. If the target wishes to avoid the spell, it can attempt a Will save\
  \ to reduce the effects.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The target is unaffected.  \n\
  \n**Success**  The target heals half as much from heal and takes half as much damage\
  \ from harm for 1 round.  \n\n**Failure**  Effects as described in the text.  \n\
  \n**Heightened (+1)**  The status bonus to the Hit Points restored increases by\
  \ 2."
