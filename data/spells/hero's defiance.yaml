cast: '|F| verbal'
components:
- Verbal
descr: You shout in defiance, filling you with a sudden burst of healing. Just before
  applying the attack's damage, you recover 10d4+20 Hit Points. If this is enough
  to prevent the attack from bringing you to 0 Hit Points, you don't become unconscious
  or dying. Either way, cheating death is difficult, and you can't use *hero's defiance*
  again until you Refocus or the next time you prepare. *Hero's defiance* cannot be
  used against effects with the death trait or that would leave no remains, such as
  *disintegrate*.
