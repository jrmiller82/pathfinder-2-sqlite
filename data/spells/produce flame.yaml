descr: "A small ball of flame appears in the palm of your hand, and you lash out with\
  \ it either in melee or at range. Make a spell attack roll against your target's\
  \ AC. This is normally a ranged attack, but you can also make a melee attack against\
  \ a creature in your unarmed reach. On a success, you deal 1d4 fire damage plus\
  \ your spellcasting ability modifier. On a critical success, the target takes double\
  \ damage and 1d4 persistent fire damage.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (+1)**  Increase\
  \ the damage by 1d4 and the persistent damage on a critical hit by 1d4."
