descr: "You cast your thoughts through a creature's mind, sifting for information.\
  \ You access the target's memories and knowledge unless it fends you off with a\
  \ Will save.  \n\n**Success**  The target is unaffected.  \n\n**Failure**  Each\
  \ round of the spell's duration, you can Sustain the Spell to ask a different question\
  \ and attempt to uncover the answer. For each question, the target can attempt a\
  \ Deception check against your spell DC; if the target succeeds, you don't learn\
  \ the answer, and on a critical success, the target gives you a false answer that\
  \ you believe is truthful Once you've asked the target a given question, asking\
  \ it again, even with a separate casting of mind probe, produces the same result.\
  \  \n\n**Critical Failure**  As failure, and the target takes a -4 circumstance\
  \ penalty to Deception checks against your questions."
