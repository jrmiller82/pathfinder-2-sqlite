descr: "You gain a vague glimpse of the future. During the casting of this spell,\
  \ ask about the results of a particular course of action. The spell can predict\
  \ results up to 30 minutes into the future and reveals the GM's best guess among\
  \ the following outcomes:\n\n* **Weal** The results will be good. \n\n* **Woe**\
  \ The results will be bad. \n\n* **Weal and Woe** The results will be a mix of good\
  \ and bad. \n\n* **Nothing** There won't be particularly good or bad results. \n\
  \nThe GM rolls a secret DC 6 flat check. On a failure, the result is always \"nothing.\"\
  \ This makes it impossible to tell whether a \"nothing\" result is accurate. If\
  \ anyone asks about the same topic as the first casting of *augury* during an additional\
  \ casting, the GM uses the secret roll result from the first casting. If circumstances\
  \ change, though, it's possible to get a different result."
