descr: "You transport the target into an extradimensional maze of eldritch origin\
  \ and trap it there. Once each turn, the target can spend 1 action to attempt a\
  \ Survival check or Perception check against your spell DC to escape the maze. The\
  \ possible outcomes are as follows.Teleportation magic doesn't help the creature\
  \ escape unless the magic can transport across planes, such as plane shift. When\
  \ the spell ends, either because the target escaped or the duration ran out, the\
  \ target returns to the space it occupied when it was banished, or to the nearest\
  \ space if the original is now filled.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The target escapes\
  \ and the spell ends.  \n\n**Success**  The target escapes and the spell ends. \
  \ \n\n**Failure**  The target makes no progress toward escape.  \n\n**Critical Failure**\
  \  The target makes no progress toward escape, and if it was on the right path,\
  \ it no longer is."
