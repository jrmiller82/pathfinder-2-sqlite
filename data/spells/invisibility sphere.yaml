descr: "You and all targets are invisible except to each other as long as you remain\
  \ within the spell's area. If a creature made invisible by this spell leaves the\
  \ spell's area, it becomes visible and remains so even if it returns to the spell's\
  \ area. If any creature made invisible by this spell uses a hostile action, the\
  \ spell ends after the hostile action is completed. While exploring, it's easy to\
  \ move together slowly and remain invisible. This is untenable in a battle, however.\
  \ Once an encounter begins, creatures remain invisible until at most the end of\
  \ the first round, at which point the spell ends.  \n\n**Heightened (5th)**  The\
  \ duration increases to 1 hour."
