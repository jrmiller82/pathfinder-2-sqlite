descr: "The target's senses are suddenly rewired in unexpected ways, causing them\
  \ to process noises as bursts of color, smells as sounds, and so on. This has three\
  \ effects, and the target must attempt a Will save. Due to the distraction, the\
  \ target must succeed at a DC 5 flat check each time it uses a concentrate action,\
  \ or the action fails and is wasted. The target's difficulty processing visual input\
  \ makes all creatures and objects concealed from it. The creature has trouble moving,\
  \ making it clumsy 3 and giving it a -10-foot status penalty to its Speeds.  \n\n\
  **Critical Success**  The target is unaffected.  \n\n**Success**  The target is\
  \ affected for 1 round.  \n\n**Failure**  The target is affected for 1 minute. \
  \ \n\n**Critical Failure**  As failure, and the target is stunned 2 as it attempts\
  \ to process the sensory shifts."
