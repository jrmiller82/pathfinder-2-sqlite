cast: '|2| somatic, verbal'
components:
- Somatic
- Verbal
descr: "You shake the ground, topple creatures into fissures, and collapse structures.\
  \ The GM might add additional effects in certain areas. Cliffs might collapse, causing\
  \ creatures to fall, or a lake might drain as fissures open up below its surface,\
  \ leaving a morass of quicksand. \n\n* **Shaking Ground** The ground is difficult\
  \ terrain, and creatures on it take a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls, AC,\
  \ and skill checks. \n\n* **Fissures** Each creature on the ground must attempt\
  \ a Reflex save at the start of its turn to keep its footing and avoid falling into\
  \ 40-foot-deep fissures that open beneath it. The fissures are permanent, and their\
  \ sides require DC 15 Athletics to Climb. \n\n* **Collapse** Structures and ceilings\
  \ might collapse. The GM rolls a flat check for each (DC 16 for a sturdy structure,\
  \ DC 14 for an average structure and most natural formations, DC 9 for a shoddy\
  \ structure, all adjusted higher or lower as the GM sees fit). A collapse deals\
  \ 11d6 bludgeoning damage; each creature caught in a collapse must attempt a Reflex\
  \ save to avoid it.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The creature takes half the collapse\
  \ damage.  \n\n**Success**  The creature takes half the collapse damage and falls\
  \ prone.  \n\n**Failure**  The creature takes the full collapse damage and falls\
  \ prone.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  The creature takes the full collapse damage\
  \ and falls into a fissure.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (10th)**  You create a massive\
  \ earthquake that can devastate a settlement. The range increases to half a mile\
  \ and the area to a quarter-mile burst."
