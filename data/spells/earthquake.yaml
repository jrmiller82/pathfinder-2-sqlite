descr: "You shake the ground, topple creatures into fissures, and collapse structures.\
  \ The GM might add additional effects in certain areas. Cliffs might collapse, causing\
  \ creatures to fall, or a lake might drain as fissures open up below its surface,\
  \ leaving a morass of quicksand. Shaking Ground The ground is difficult terrain,\
  \ and creatures on it take a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls, AC, and skill\
  \ checks. Fissures Each creature on the ground must attempt a Reflex save at the\
  \ start of its turn to keep its footing and avoid falling into 40-foot-deep fissures\
  \ that open beneath it. The fissures are permanent, and their sides require DC 15\
  \ Athletics to Climb. Collapse Structures and ceilings might collapse. The GM rolls\
  \ a flat check for each (DC 16 for a sturdy structure, DC 14 for an average structure\
  \ and most natural formations, DC 9 for a shoddy structure, all adjusted higher\
  \ or lower as the GM sees fit). A collapse deals 11d6 bludgeoning damage; each creature\
  \ caught in a collapse must attempt a Reflex save to avoid it.  \n\n**Critical Success**\
  \  The creature takes half the collapse damage.  \n\n**Success**  The creature takes\
  \ half the collapse damage and falls prone.  \n\n**Failure**  The creature takes\
  \ the full collapse damage and falls prone.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  The creature\
  \ takes the full collapse damage and falls into a fissure.  \n\n**Heightened (10th)**\
  \  You create a massive earthquake that can devastate a settlement. The range increases\
  \ to half a mile and the area to a quarter-mile burst."
