descr: "You form an invisible wall of pure magical force up to 50 feet long and up\
  \ to 20 feet high. The wall has no discernible thickness. You must create the wall\
  \ in an unbroken open space so its edges don't pass through any creatures or objects,\
  \ or the spell is lost. The wall has AC 10, Hardness 30, and 60 Hit Points, and\
  \ it's immune to critical hits and precision damage. The wall blocks physical effects\
  \ from passing through it, and because it's made of force, it blocks incorporeal\
  \ and ethereal creatures as well. Teleportation effects can pass through the barrier,\
  \ as can visual effects (since the wall is invisible). \n\n*Wall of force* is immune\
  \ to counteracting effects of its level or lower, but the wall is automatically\
  \ destroyed by a disintegrate spell of any level or by contact with a *rod of cancellation*\
  \ or *sphere of annihilation*.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (+2)**  The Hit Points of\
  \ the wall increases by 20."
