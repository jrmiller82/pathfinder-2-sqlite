descr: A burst of healing energy soothes living creatures and temporarily rouses those
  recently slain. All living targets regain 10d8+40 Hit Points. In addition, you return
  any number of dead targets to life temporarily, with the same effects and limitations
  as *raise dead*. The raised creatures have a number of temporary Hit Points equal
  to the Hit Points you gave living creatures, but no normal Hit Points. The raised
  creatures can't regain Hit Points or gain temporary Hit Points in other ways, and
  once revival's duration ends, they lose all temporary Hit Points and die. *Revival*
  can't resurrect creatures killed by *disintegrate* or a death effect. It has no
  effect on undead.
