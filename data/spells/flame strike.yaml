descr: "You call a rain of divine fire that plummets down from above, dealing 8d6\
  \ fire damage. Because the flame is infused with divine energy, creatures in the\
  \ area apply only half their usual fire resistance. Creatures that are immune to\
  \ fire, instead of gaining the usual benefit of immunity, treat the results of their\
  \ saving throws as one degree of success better.  \n\n**Heightened (+1)**  The damage\
  \ increases by 2d6."
