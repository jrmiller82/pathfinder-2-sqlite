descr: "The target appears to be a gruesome and terrifying creature. The effect is\
  \ unique to each observer, so a human viewing the target might see a demon with\
  \ bloody fangs, but a demon observing the target might see a glowing angelic visage.\
  \ When any creature attempts a hostile action against the target, the creature must\
  \ attempt a Will save. It is then temporarily immune until the end of its next turn.\
  \  \n\n**Success**  The creature is unaffected.  \n\n**Failure**  The creature becomes\
  \ frightened 2 before using its action.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  The creature\
  \ becomes frightened 2, and its action fails and is wasted.  \n\n**Heightened (8th)**\
  \  You can target up to 5 creatures. If a creature uses a hostile action or reaction\
  \ that affects multiple targets simultaneously, it needs to attempt only one save\
  \ against mask of terror."
