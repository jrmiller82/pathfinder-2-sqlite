descr: "You imbue the target berry with the bounty of nature, allowing it to heal\
  \ and sustain far beyond its normal capacity. A living creature that eats the berry\
  \ with an Interact action gains as much nourishment as from a square meal for a\
  \ typical human and regains 1d8+5 Hit Points. If it's not consumed during the duration,\
  \ or if you cast goodberry again, the berry withers away.  \n\n**Heightened (+1)**\
  \  You can target an additional berry."
