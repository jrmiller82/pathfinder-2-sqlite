descr: "The sky above you darkens in a matter of moments, swirling with ominous clouds\
  \ punctuated by flashes of lighting. Each round when you Sustain the Spell, you\
  \ can select one of the following effects to occur in the area.  \n\n* **Calm**\
  \ No additional effect. \n\n* **Fog** Heavy fog rolls in, concealing the area with\
  \ the effects of *obscuring mist*. \n\n* **Rain** Torrential rain falls from the\
  \ sky, dousing ordinary flames. Creatures in the area take a -2 circumstance penalty\
  \ to Acrobatics and Perception checks. \n\n* **Wind** Powerful winds buffet the\
  \ area in all directions. Ranged attacks take a -4 circumstance penalty, and all\
  \ flying is against the wind and counts as moving through difficult terrain. \n\n\
  In addition, once per round you can use a single action, which has the concentrate\
  \ and manipulate traits, to call down a bolt of lightning, striking any target in\
  \ range that you can see. You deal 10d6 electricity damage to the target; it must\
  \ attempt a basic Reflex save. On a failure, it is also deafened for 1 round."
