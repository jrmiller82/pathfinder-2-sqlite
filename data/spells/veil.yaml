descr: "You disguise the targets as other creatures of the same body shape and roughly\
  \ similar height (within 6 inches) and weight (within 50 pounds). The disguise can\
  \ hide the targets' identities or let them appear to be of another ancestry, but\
  \ it's not precise enough to impersonate specific individuals. The spell doesn't\
  \ change voice, scent, or mannerisms. You choose the disguise for each target; for\
  \ example, you could make one target appear to be a dwarf and another an elf. \n\
  \nCasting *veil* counts as setting up a disguise for the purpose of the Impersonate\
  \ action. It allows the target to ignore any circumstance penalties they might take\
  \ for being disguised as dissimilar creatures, and it gives the targets a +4 status\
  \ bonus to Deception checks to prevent others from seeing through their disguises,\
  \ and add their level even if untrained. You can Dismiss any or all of these disguises.\
  \  \n\n---\n**Heightened (5th)**  The spell also disguises the targets' voices and\
  \ scents; it gains the auditory trait.  \n\n**Heightened (7th)**  The targets can\
  \ appear as any creature of the same size, even specific individuals. You must have\
  \ seen an individual to reproduce their appearance. The spell also disguises the\
  \ targets' voices and scents; it gains the auditory trait."
