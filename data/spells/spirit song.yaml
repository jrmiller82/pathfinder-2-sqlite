descr: "Your eldritch song sends pulsing waves of ethereal energy to attack creatures'\
  \ spirits in the area, dealing 18d6 force damage. Because *spirit song* affects\
  \ creatures' spirits, it can damage a target projecting its consciousness (such\
  \ as via *project image*) or possessing another creature even if the target's body\
  \ is elsewhere. The vibrating waves of spiritual song penetrate into, but not through,\
  \ solid barriers, damaging incorporeal creatures hiding in solid objects in the\
  \ area but not passing onward to damage creatures in other rooms. Possessed creatures\
  \ aren't harmed by the song. The song doesn't harm creatures that have no spirit,\
  \ such as constructs.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (+1)**  The damage increases by 2d6."
