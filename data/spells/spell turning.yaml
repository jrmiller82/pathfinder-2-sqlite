descr: This abjuration reflects spells cast at you back at their caster. When a spell
  targets you, you can spend a reaction to attempt to reflect it. This uses the rules
  for counteracting the spell, but if the spell is successfully counteracted, the
  effect is turned back on the caster. Whether or not the counteract attempt is successful,
  spell turning then ends. Spell turning can't affect spells that aren't targeted
  (such as area spells). If spell turning reflects a spell back at a caster who is
  also under the effect of spell turning, their spell turning can attempt to reflect
  their own spell back at you again; if they do so, their counteract attempt automatically
  succeeds.
