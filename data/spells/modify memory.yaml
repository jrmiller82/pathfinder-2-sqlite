descr: "You alter the target's memories, either erasing a memory, enhancing a memory's\
  \ clarity, altering a memory, or adding a false memory. The target can attempt a\
  \ Will save to resist the spell.Any memories you've altered remain changed as long\
  \ as the spell is active. If the target moves out of range before the 5 minutes\
  \ is up, you can't alter any further memories.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The target\
  \ is unaffected and realizes you tried to alter its memory.  \n\n**Success**  The\
  \ target is unaffected but thinks your spell was something harmless instead of modify\
  \ memory, unless it identifies the spell.  \n\n**Failure**  During the first 5 minutes\
  \ of the spell's duration, you can Sustain the Spell to modify a memory once each\
  \ round. When you do, you imagine up to 6 seconds of memory to modify, to a maximum\
  \ of 5 continuous minutes of memory.  \n\n**Heightened (6th)**  You can cast the\
  \ spell on a willing target to suppress all memory of a particular topic, detailed\
  \ in 50 words or fewer. The effect is permanent, and it patches these omissions\
  \ with an indistinct haze."
