descr: "You rarely settle for being in just one place. Choose a location within 100\
  \ feet of the target that the target can see. You create an illusion of yourself\
  \ there that only it can see and that mimics all your actions. The target must attempt\
  \ a Will save.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The target is unaffected.  \n\n**Success**\
  \  The target believes you're in the designated location and can't see you in your\
  \ actual location. The target automatically disbelieves the illusion when you use\
  \ an action that doesn't make sense in the illusion's position, or if the target\
  \ attacks, touches, Seeks, or otherwise engages with the illusion. If you use a\
  \ hostile action against the target, the spell ends.  \n\n**Failure**  As success,\
  \ but the target must succeed at a Will save to disbelieve the illusion when one\
  \ of the listed events occurs.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  As success, but the target\
  \ must critically succeed at a Will save to disbelieve when one of the listed events\
  \ occurs."
