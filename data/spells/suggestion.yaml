descr: "Your honeyed words are difficult for creatures to resist. You suggest a course\
  \ of action to the target, which must be phrased in such a way as to seem like a\
  \ logical course of action to the target and can't be self-destructive or obviously\
  \ against the target's self-interest. The target must attempt a Will save.  \n\n\
  **Critical Success**  The target is unaffected and knows you tried to control it.\
  \  \n\n**Success**  The target is unaffected and thinks you were talking to them\
  \ normally, not casting a spell on them.  \n\n**Failure**  The target immediately\
  \ follows your suggestion. The spell has a duration of 1 minute, or until the target\
  \ has completed a finite suggestion or the suggestion becomes self-destructive or\
  \ has other obvious negative effects.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  As failure, but\
  \ the base duration is 1 hour.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (8th)**  You can target up\
  \ to 10 creatures."
