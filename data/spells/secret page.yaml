descr: You change the target's text to different text entirely. If the text is a spellbook
  or a scroll, you can change it to show a spell you know of *secret page*'s level
  or lower. The replacement spell cannot be cast or used to prepare a spell. You can
  also transform the text into some other text you have written or have access to.
  You can specify a password that allows a creature touching the page to change the
  text back and forth. You must choose the replacement text and the password, if any,
  when you Cast the Spell.
