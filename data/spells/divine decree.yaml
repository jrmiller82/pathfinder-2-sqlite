descr: "You utter a potent litany from your faith, a mandate that harms those who\
  \ oppose your ideals. Choose an alignment your deity has (chaotic, evil, good, or\
  \ lawful). You can't cast this spell if you don't have a deity or your deity is\
  \ true neutral. This spell gains the trait of the alignment you chose. You deal\
  \ 7d10 damage to creatures in the area; each creature must attempt a Fortitude save.\
  \ Creatures with an alignment that matches the one you chose are unaffected by the\
  \ spell. Those that neither match nor oppose it treat the result of their saving\
  \ throw as one degree better and don't suffer effects other than damage.  \n\n**Critical\
  \ Success**  The creature is unaffected.  \n\n**Success**  The creature takes half\
  \ damage.  \n\n**Failure**  The creature takes full damage and is enfeebled 2 for\
  \ 1 minute.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  The creature takes double damage and is enfeebled\
  \ 2 for 1 minute. On your home plane, a creature that critically fails is banished\
  \ with the effect of a failed *banishment* save. A 10th-level creature or lower\
  \ must attempt a Will save. On a failure, it's paralyzed for 1 minute; on a critical\
  \ failure, it dies.**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d10 and the level\
  \ of creatures that must attempt a second save on a critical failure increases by\
  \ 2"
