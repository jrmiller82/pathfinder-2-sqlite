descr: "You create an immobile sphere of force to either trap or protect the target,\
  \ blocking anything that would pass through the sphere. The sphere has AC 5, Hardness\
  \ 10, and 40 Hit Points. It's immune to critical hits and precision damage. Disintegrate\
  \ destroys the sphere instantly. If the target is unwilling, the effects of the\
  \ sphere depend on the target's Reflex save.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The target\
  \ disrupts the sphere's integrity, causing it to collapse entirely.  \n\n**Success**\
  \  The sphere functions normally but has only 10 Hit Points instead of 40.  \n\n\
  **Failure**  The sphere has its normal effect."
