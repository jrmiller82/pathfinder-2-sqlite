descr: "An immense weapon of force appears, hovering in the air above the target.\
  \ The weapon has the ghostly visual appearance of your deity's favored weapon. Name\
  \ war or peace when you cast this spell. If you name \"war,\" mentally choose one\
  \ creature. This must be a creature both you and the target can see. The target\
  \ instinctively knows which creature this is. At the end of each of the target's\
  \ turns, if the target did not use a hostile action against the creature you chose\
  \ during that turn, the weapon Strikes the target. If you name \"peace,\" mentally\
  \ choose up to five allies. The target instinctively knows who those allies are.\
  \ The weapon Strikes the target each time the target uses a hostile action against\
  \ you or one of your allies. The weapon Strikes only once per action, even if the\
  \ action targets multiple allies (such as for a fireball or a <%FEATS%Whirlwind\
  \ Strike%%>Whirlwind Strike). Strikes with the weapon are melee weapon attacks,\
  \ but they use your spell attack modifier. Regardless of its appearance, the weapon\
  \ deals force damage equal to 3d10 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. The\
  \ weapon takes a multiple attack penalty, which increases throughout the target's\
  \ turn, but its penalty is separate from yours. When the weapon Strikes, you can\
  \ deal damage of the normal damage type of the weapon instead of force damage (or\
  \ any of the available damage types, for a versatile weapon). No other statistics\
  \ or attributes of the weapon apply, and even a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures\
  \ only. A weapon of judgment is a weapon for the purposes of triggers, resistances,\
  \ and so forth. The weapon doesn't take up space, grant flanking, or have any other\
  \ attributes a creature would. The weapon can't make any attack other than its Strike,\
  \ and feats or spells that affect weapons do not apply to this weapon.  \n\n**Heightened\
  \ (10th)**  The force damage increases by 1d10."
