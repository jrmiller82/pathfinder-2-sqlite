descr: "An immense weapon of force appears, hovering in the air above the target.\
  \ The weapon has the ghostly visual appearance of your deity's favored weapon. Name\
  \ war or peace when you cast this spell. \n\nIf you name \"war,\" mentally choose\
  \ one creature. This must be a creature both you and the target can see. The target\
  \ instinctively knows which creature this is. At the end of each of the target's\
  \ turns, if the target did not use a hostile action against the creature you chose\
  \ during that turn, the weapon Strikes the target. \n\nIf you name \"peace,\" mentally\
  \ choose up to five allies. The target instinctively knows who those allies are.\
  \ The weapon Strikes the target each time the target uses a hostile action against\
  \ you or one of your allies. The weapon Strikes only once per action, even if the\
  \ action targets multiple allies (such as for a *fireball* or a Whirlwind Strike).\
  \ \n\nStrikes with the weapon are melee weapon attacks, but they use your spell\
  \ attack modifier. Regardless of its appearance, the weapon deals force damage equal\
  \ to 3d10 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. The weapon takes a multiple attack\
  \ penalty, which increases throughout the target's turn, but its penalty is separate\
  \ from yours. \n\nWhen the weapon Strikes, you can deal damage of the normal damage\
  \ type of the weapon instead of force damage (or any of the available damage types,\
  \ for a versatile weapon). No other statistics or attributes of the weapon apply,\
  \ and even a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only. A weapon of judgment\
  \ is a weapon for the purposes of triggers, resistances, and so forth. \n\nThe weapon\
  \ doesn't take up space, grant flanking, or have any other attributes a creature\
  \ would. The weapon can't make any attack other than its Strike, and feats or spells\
  \ that affect weapons do not apply to this weapon.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (10th)**\
  \  The force damage increases by 1d10."
