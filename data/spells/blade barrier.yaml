descr: "Blades of force form a churning wall. The wall is a straight line 20 feet\
  \ high, 120 feet long, and 2 inches thick, and it provides cover. The wall deals\
  \ 7d8 force damage to each creature that's in the wall's space when it is created,\
  \ that attempts to pass through the wall, or that ends its turn inside the wall.\
  \ A basic Reflex save reduces the damage. A  creature that succeeds at this save\
  \ when the wall is created is pushed to the nearest space on the side of its choice.\
  \ Creatures trying to move through the wall fail to do so if they critically fail\
  \ the save, ending their movement adjacent to the wall.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (+1)**\
  \  The damage increases by 1d8."
