descr: "Your words fascinate your targets. You speak or sing without interruption\
  \ throughout the casting and duration. Targets who notice your speech or song might\
  \ give their undivided attention; each target must attempt a Will save. The GM might\
  \ grant a circumstance bonus (to a maximum of +4) if the target is of an opposing\
  \ religion, ancestry, or political leaning, or is otherwise unlikely to agree with\
  \ what you're saying. Each creature that comes within range has to attempt a save\
  \ when you Sustain the Spell. If you're speaking, enthrall gains the linguistic\
  \ trait.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The target is unaffected and notices that you\
  \ tried to use magic.  \n\n**Success**  The target needn't pay attention but doesn't\
  \ notice you tried to use magic (it might notice others are enthralled).  \n\n**Failure**\
  \  The target is fascinated with you. It can attempt another Will save if it witnesses\
  \ actions or speech with which it disagrees. If it succeeds, it's no longer fascinated\
  \ and is temporarily immune for 1 hour. If the target is subject to a hostile act,\
  \ or if another creature succeeds at a Diplomacy or Intimidation check against it,\
  \ the fascination ends immediately.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  As failure, but the\
  \ target can't attempt a save to end the fascination if it disagrees with you."
