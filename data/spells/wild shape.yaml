descr: "You infuse yourself with primal essence and transform yourself into another\
  \ form. You can polymorph into any form listed in *pest form*, which lasts 10 minutes.\
  \ All other *wild shape* forms last 1 minute. You can add more forms to your *wild\
  \ shape* list with druid feats; your feat might grant you some or all of the forms\
  \ from a given polymorph spell. When you transform into a form granted by a spell,\
  \ you gain all the effects of the form you chose from a version of the spell heightened\
  \ to *wild shape*'s level. *Wild shape* allows you to use your own shapeshifting\
  \ training more easily than most polymorph spells. When you choose to use your own\
  \ attack modifier while polymorphed instead of the form's default attack modifier,\
  \ you gain a +2 status bonus to your attack rolls.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (2nd)**\
  \  You can also *wild shape* into the forms listed in animal form."
