descr: Powerful wards hide a creature from divination magic. The target gains a +4
  status bonus to saves against mental effects. *Mind blank* attempts to counteract
  any detection, revelation, and scrying effects as if its spell level were 1 higher
  than its actual level. On a success, the divination effect functions normally except
  that it detects nothing about the target and its possessions. For instance, *detect
  magic* would still detect other magic in the area, but not any magic on the target.
