descr: "The target consistently detects one thing as another, can't detect something\
  \ that's there, or detects something that's not there, though it doesn't alter their\
  \ beliefs. You choose which of these effects applies, and you determine the specifics\
  \ of the hallucination. For example, you could make the target see all elves as\
  \ humans, be unable to detect the presence of their brother, see their beloved pocket\
  \ watch on their person even when it isn't, or see a tower in the center of town.\
  \ \n\nThe target can attempt an initial Will save, with effects below. They also\
  \ receive a Will save to disbelieve the hallucination every time they Seek or directly\
  \ interact with the hallucination. For example, the target could attempt to disbelieve\
  \ the hallucination each time they interacted with an elf, bumped into their brother\
  \ accidentally, tried to check their pocket watch, or studied the tower. The target\
  \ can attempt to disbelieve with a large circumstance bonus in situations determined\
  \ by the GM, such as if the target attempted to climb the nonexistent tower.  \n\
  \n**Critical Success**  The creature is unaffected.  \n\n**Success**  The creature\
  \ perceives what you chose until it disbelieves, but it knows what the hallucination\
  \ is.  \n\n**Failure**  The creature perceives what you chose until it disbelieves.\
  \  \n\n**Critical Failure**  The creature perceives what you chose until it disbelieves,\
  \ and it trusts its false senses, taking a -4 circumstance penalty to saves to disbelieve.\
  \  \n\n---\n**Heightened (6th)**  Choose to either target up to 10 creatures or\
  \ change the spell's duration to until the next time you make your daily preparations.\
  \  \n\n**Heightened (8th)**  Choose to either target any number of creatures or\
  \ change the spell's duration to unlimited."
