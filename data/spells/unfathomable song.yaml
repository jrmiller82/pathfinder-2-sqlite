descr: "Fleeting notes of a strange and unnatural song fill the air, overtaking the\
  \ mind. Each target must attempt a Will save when you cast the spell, and again\
  \ each time you Sustain the Spell. A creature needs to attempt only one save against\
  \ the song each round, and you have to keep the same targets when you Sustain the\
  \ Spell.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The target is unaffected, can't be affected\
  \ on subsequent rounds, and is temporarily immune for 1 minute.  \n\n**Success**\
  \  The target is unaffected this round, but it can be affected on subsequent rounds.\
  \  \n\n**Failure**  Roll 1d4 on the table below.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  Roll\
  \ 1d4+1 on the table below."
