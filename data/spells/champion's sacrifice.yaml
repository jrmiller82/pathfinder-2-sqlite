action_abbr: R
cast: '|R| somatic'
components:
- Somatic
descr: You form a link with an ally, allowing you to take harm in their stead. All
  the effects of the hit or failed save are applied to you instead of the ally. For
  example, if the target critically fails a saving throw against a *fireball*, you
  would take double damage. These effects ignore any resistances, immunities, or other
  abilities you have that might mitigate them in any way, although those of the target
  apply before you take the effect.
