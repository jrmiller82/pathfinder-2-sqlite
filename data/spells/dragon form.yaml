descr: "Calling upon powerful transformative magic, you gain a Large dragon battle\
  \ form. You must have space to expand or the spell is lost. When you cast this spell,\
  \ choose one type of chromatic or metallic dragon. While in this form, you gain\
  \ the dragon trait. You have hands in this battle form and can take manipulate actions.\
  \ You can Dismiss the spell.  \n\nYou gain the following statistics and abilities\
  \ regardless of which battle form you choose:  \n\n * AC = 18 + your level.\n\n\
  \ * Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.\n\n * 10 temporary Hit\
  \ Points.\n\n * Speed 40 feet, fly Speed 100 feet.\n\n * Resistance 10 against the\
  \ damage type of your breath weapon (see below).\n\n * Darkvision and imprecise\
  \ scent 60 feet.\n\n * One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle\
  \ form you choose, which are the only attacks you can use. You're trained with them.\
  \ Your attack modifier is +22, and your damage bonus is +6. These attacks are Strength\
  \ based (for the purpose of the enfeebled condition, for example). If your unarmed\
  \ attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead. See below for more on these\
  \ attacks.\n\n * Athletics modifier of +23, unless your own modifier is higher.\n\
  \n * **Breath Weapon** |2| (arcane, evocation) The shape, damage, and damage type\

  \ in the area attempts a basic save against your spell DC. This is a Reflex save\
  \ unless stated otherwise in the special ability description for your specific dragon\
  \ form. Once activated, your breath weapon can't be used again for 1d4 rounds. Your\
  \ breath weapon has the trait corresponding to the type of damage it deals.\n\n\
