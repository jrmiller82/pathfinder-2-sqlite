descr: "You assault the target's faith, riddling the creature with doubt and mental\
  \ turmoil that deal 6d6 mental damage, or 6d8 mental damage if it can cast divine\
  \ spells. The effects are determined by its Will save. \n\n**Critical Success**\
  \  The target is unaffected.  \n\n**Success**  The target takes half damage.  \n\
  \n**Failure**  The target takes full damage; if the target can cast divine spells,\
  \ it's stupefied 1 for 1 round.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  The target takes double\
  \ damage, is stupefied 1 for 1 round, and can't cast divine spells for 1 round.\n\
  \nTo many deities, casting this spell on a follower of your own deity without significant\
  \ cause is anathema.\n\n---\n**Heightened (+1)**  The damage increases by 2d6 (or\
  \ by 2d8 if the target is a divine spellcaster)."
