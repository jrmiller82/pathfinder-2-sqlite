descr: "You utter the most powerful arcane word of power. Once targeted, the target\
  \ is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes. The effect of the spell depends on\
  \ the target's level. \n\n**14th or Lower** The target dies instantly.\n\n**15th**\
  \ If the target has 50 Hit Points or fewer, it dies instantly; otherwise, it drops\
  \ to 0 Hit Points and becomes dying 1, or increases its dying condition by 1 if\
  \ it's already dying. \n\n**16th** or Higher The target takes 50 damage; if this\
  \ brings the target to 0 Hit Points, the target dies instantly.  \n\n---\n**Heightened\
  \ (10th)**  The levels at which each outcome applies increase by 2."
