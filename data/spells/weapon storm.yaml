descr: "You swing a weapon you're holding, and the weapon magically multiplies into\
  \ duplicates that swipe at all creatures in either a cone or an emanation. This\
  \ flurry deals four dice of damage to creatures in the area. This damage has the\
  \ same type as the weapon and uses the same die size. Determine the die size as\
  \ if you were attacking with the weapon; for instance, if you were wielding a two-hand\
  \ weapon in both hands, you'd use its two-hand damage die.  \n\n**Critical Success**\
  \  The creature is unaffected.  \n\n**Success**  The target takes half damage. \
  \ \n\n**Failure**  The target takes full damage.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  The\
  \ target takes double damage and is subject to the weapon's critical specialization\
  \ effect.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (+1)**  Add another damage die."
