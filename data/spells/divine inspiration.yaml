descr: You infuse a target with spiritual energy, refreshing its magic. If it prepares
  spells, it recovers one 6th-level or lower spell it previously cast today and can
  cast that spell again. If it spontaneously casts spells, it recovers one of its
  6th-level or lower spell slots. If it has a focus pool, it regains its Focus Points,
  as if it had Refocused.
