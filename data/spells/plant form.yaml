descr: "Taking inspiration from verdant creatures, you transform into a Large plant\
  \ battle form. You must have space to expand into or the spell is lost. When you\
  \ cast this spell, choose arboreal, flytrap, or shambler. You can substitute a similar\
  \ specific plant to turn into (such as a pitcher plant instead of a flytrap), but\
  \ this has no effect on the form's Size or statistics. While in this form, you gain\
  \ the plant trait. You can Dismiss the spell. You gain the following statistics\
  \ and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:  \n\n * AC = 19 + your\
  \ level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.\n\n * 12 temporary\
  \ Hit Points.\n\n * Resistance 10 to poison.\n\n * Low-light vision.\n\n * One or\
  \ more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the\
  \ only attacks you can use. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +17,\
  \ and your damage bonus is +11. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose\
  \ of the enfeebled condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher,\
  \ you can use it instead.\n\n * Athletics modifier of +19, unless your own modifier\
  \ is higher.\n\n  \n\nYou also gain specific abilities based on the type of plant\
  \ you choose:\n\n * **Arboreal** Speed 30 feet; **Melee** |1| branch (reach 15 feet),\
  \ **Damage** 2d10 bludgeoning; **Melee** |1| foot, **Damage** 2d8 bludgeoning; you\
  \ can speak in this form, but you still can't Cast a Spell or supply verbal components.\n\
  \n * **Flytrap** Speed 15 feet; resistance 10 to acid; **Melee** |1| leaf (reach\
  \ 10 feet), **Damage** 2d8 piercing, and you can spend an action after a hit to\
  \ Grab the target.\n\n * **Shambler** Speed 20 feet, swim Speed 20 feet; resistance\
  \ 10 to electricity; **Melee** |1| vine (reach 15 feet), **Damage** 2d8 slashing.\n\
  \n  \n\n**Heightened (6th)**  Your battle form is Huge, and the reach of your attacks\
  \ increases by 5 feet. You instead gain AC = 22 + your level, 24 temporary HP, attack\
  \ modifier +21, damage bonus +16, and Athletics +22."
