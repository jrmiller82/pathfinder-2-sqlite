descr: "You grant the target corpse a semblance of life, which it uses to speak the\
  \ answers to three questions posed to it. This spell calls on the physical body's\
  \ latent memories rather than summoning back the deceased's spirit, so the corpse\
  \ must be mostly intact for the spell to function. The more damage the corpse has\
  \ taken, the more inaccurate or patchwork its answers are, and it must have a throat\
  \ and mouth to speak at all. If anyone has previously cast this spell on the corpse\
  \ in the last week, the spell automatically fails. The corpse can attempt a Will\
  \ save to resist answering the questions using the statistics of the original creature\
  \ at its time of death, with the following effects.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The\
  \ target can lie or refuse to answer your questions, and the target's spirit haunts\
  \ you for 24 hours, bothering you and causing you to be unable to gain any rest\
  \ for that time.  \n\n**Success**  The target can provide false information or refuse\
  \ to answer your questions.  \n\n**Failure**  The target must answer truthfully,\
  \ but its answers can be brief, cryptic, and repetitive. It can still mislead you\
  \ or attempt to stall so that the spell's duration runs out before you can ask all\
  \ your questions.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  As failure, but the target's answers\
  \ are more direct and less repetitive, though still cryptic. It takes a -2 status\
  \ penalty to Deception checks to deceive or mislead you."
