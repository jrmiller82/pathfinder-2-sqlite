descr: "A vision of apocalyptic destruction fills the mind of each creature in the\
  \ area. The vision deals 11d6 mental damage (basic Will save). On a critical failure,\
  \ the creature must also succeed at a Reflex save or believe it's trapped (stuck\
  \ in a fissure, adrift at sea, or some other fate in keeping with its vision). If\
  \ it fails the second save, it's also stunned for 1 minute. It can attempt a new\
  \ Will save at the end of each of its turns, and on a success, it disbelieves the\
  \ illusion and recovers from the stunned condition.  \n\n**Heightened (+1)**  The\
  \ damage increases by 2d6."
