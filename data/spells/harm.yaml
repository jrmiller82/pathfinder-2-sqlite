descr: "You channel negative energy to harm the living or heal the undead. If the\
  \ target is a living creature, you deal 1d8 negative damage to it, and it gets a\
  \ basic Fortitude save. If the target is a willing undead creature, you restore\
  \ that amount of Hit Points. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell\
  \ determines its targets, range, area, and other parameters.  \n\n  \n\n |1| (somatic)\
  \ The spell has a range of touch.  \n\n |2| (verbal, somatic) The spell has a range\
  \ of 30 feet. If you're healing an undead creature, increase the Hit Points restored\
  \ by 8.  \n\n |3| (material, verbal, somatic) You disperse negative energy in a\
  \ 30-foot emanation. This targets all living and undead creatures in the area. \
  \ \n\n---\n**Heightened (+1)**  The amount of healing or damage increases by 1d8,\
  \ and the extra healing for the 2-action version increases by 8."
