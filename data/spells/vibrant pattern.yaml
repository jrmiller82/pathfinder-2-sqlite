descr: "You create a pattern of lights that pulses with intensity. Creatures are dazzled\
  \ while inside the pattern. \n\nIn addition, a creature must attempt a Will saving\
  \ throw if it's inside the pattern when you cast it, enters the pattern, ends its\
  \ turn within the pattern, or uses a Seek or Interact action on the pattern. A creature\
  \ currently blinded by the pattern doesn't need to attempt new saving throws.  \n\
  \n**Success**  The creature is unaffected.  \n\n**Failure**  The creature is blinded\
  \ by the pattern. If it exits the pattern, it can attempt a new save to recover\
  \ from the blinded condition at the end of each of its turns, to a maximum duration\
  \ of 1 minute.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  The creature is blinded for 1 minute."
