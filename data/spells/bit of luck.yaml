descr: "You tilt the scales of luck slightly to protect a creature from disaster.\
  \ When the target would attempt a saving throw, it can roll twice and use the better\
  \ result. Once it does this, the spell ends. \n\nIf you cast *bit of luck* again,\
  \ any previous *bit of luck* you cast that's still in effect ends. After a creature\
  \ has been targeted with bit of luck, it becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours."
