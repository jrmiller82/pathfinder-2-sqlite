components:
- Somatic
- Verbal
descr: You ward a creature against the effects of a single spell. Choose a spell and
  name it aloud as part of the verbal component. *Spell immunity* attempts to counteract
  that spell whenever *spell immunity*'s target is the target of the named spell or
  in that spell's area. Successfully counteracting a spell that targets an area or
  multiple targets with *spell immunity* negates the effects only for the target affected
  by *spell immunity*.
