descr: "You make the target object look and feel as though it were in much better\
  \ or worse physical condition. When you cast this spell, decide whether you want\
  \ to make the object look decrepit or perfect. An item made to look decrepit appears\
  \ broken and shoddy. An intact item made to look better appears as though it's brand\
  \ new and highly polished or well maintained. A broken item appears to be intact\
  \ and functional. Destroyed items can't be affected by this spell. A creature that\
  \ Interacts with the item can attempt to disbelieve the illusion.  \n\n---\n**Heightened\
