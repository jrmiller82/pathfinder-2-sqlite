descr: The targets experience a day's worth of recovery in an instant. Any detrimental
  effects that would be gone after 24 hours end, though this doesn't shorten the duration
  of any active spells affecting the targets. The targets regain Hit Points and recover
  from conditions as if they had taken 24 hours of rest, but they do not make their
  daily preparations again or gain any benefits of rest other than healing. The targets
  are then temporarily immune for 1 day.
