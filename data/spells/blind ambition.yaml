descr: "You strengthen a target's ambition, increase its resentment of allies, and\
  \ make its allegiances more susceptible to change. The target must attempt a Will\
  \ save.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The target is unaffected.  \n\n**Success**  The\
  \ target takes a -1 status penalty to its saving throws and other defenses against\
  \ attempts to Coerce it, Request something of it, or use mental effects to convince\
  \ it to do something (such as a suggestion spell). This penalty applies only if\
  \ the target is being encouraged to advance its own ambitions.  \n\n**Failure**\
  \  As success, but the penalty is -2.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  The target is overcome\
  \ with ambition, taking whatever actions would advance its own agenda over those\
  \ of anyone else, even without attempts to convince it."
