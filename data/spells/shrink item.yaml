descr: You shrink the target to roughly the size of a coin. This reduces it to negligible
  Bulk. You can Dismiss the spell, and the spell ends if you toss the object onto
  a solid surface. The object can't be used to attack or cause damage during the process
  of it returning to normal size. If there isn't room for the object to return to
  normal size when the spell ends, the spell's duration continues until the object
  is in a location large enough to accommodate its normal size.
