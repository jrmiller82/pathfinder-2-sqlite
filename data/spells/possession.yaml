descr: "You send your mind and soul into the target's body, attempting to take control.\
  \ The target must attempt a Will save. You can choose to use the effects of a degree\
  \ of success more favorable to the target if you prefer. \n\nWhile you're possessing\
  \ a target, your own body is unconscious and can't wake up normally. You can sense\
  \ everything the possessed target does. You can Dismiss this spell. If the possessed\
  \ body dies, the spell ends and you must succeed at a Fortitude save against your\
  \ spell DC or be paralyzed for 1 hour, or 24 hours on a critical failure. If the\
  \ spell ends during an encounter, you act just before the possessed creature's initiative\
  \ count.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The target is unaffected.  \n\n**Success** \
  \ You possess the target but can't control it. You ride along in the body while\
  \ the spell lasts.  \n\n**Failure**  You possess the target and take partial control\
  \ of it. You no longer have a separate turn; instead, you might control the target.\
  \ At the start of each of the target's turns, it attempts another Will save. If\
  \ it fails, it's controlled by you on that turn; if it succeeds, it chooses its\
  \ own actions; and if it critically succeeds, it forces you out and the spell ends.\
  \  \n\n**Critical Failure**  You possess the target fully, and it can only watch\
  \ as you manipulate it like a puppet. The target is controlled by you.  \n\n---\n\
  **Heightened (9th)**  The duration is 10 minutes, and you can physically enter the\
  \ creature's body, protecting your physical body while the spell lasts."
