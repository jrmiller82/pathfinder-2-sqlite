descr: "You draw forth a hag's innate jealousy to deny a target its greatest attribute.\
  \ The target gains an adverse condition depending on its highest ability modifier:\
  \ Strength (enfeebled); Dexterity (clumsy); Constitution (drained); or Intelligence,\
  \ Wisdom, or Charisma (stupefied). On a tie, the creature decides which of the conditions\
  \ associated with the tied ability modifiers to take. The target must attempt a\
  \ Will save.\n\n**Success**  The target is unaffected.  \n\n**Failure**  The condition's\
  \ value is 1.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  The condition's value is 2.\n\nAt the start\
  \ of each of your turns, the target can attempt another Will save, ending the effect\
  \ on a success.  "
