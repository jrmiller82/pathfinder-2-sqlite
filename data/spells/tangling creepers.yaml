descr: Dense, twitching creepers sprout from every surface and fill any bodies of
  water in the area. Any creature moving on the land, or Climbing or Swimming within
  the creepers, takes a -10- foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds while in the
  area. Once per round, you can make a vine lash out from any square within the expanse
  of creepers by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait. This vine
  has a 15-foot reach and makes a melee unarmed attack using your spell attack modifier.
  If the attack succeeds, the vine pulls the target into the creepers and makes it
  immobilized for 1 round or until the creature Escapes (against your spell DC), whichever
  comes first.
