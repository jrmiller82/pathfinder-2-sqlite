descr: The simplest magic does your bidding. You can perform simple magical effects
  for as long as you Sustain the Spell. Each time you Sustain the Spell, you can choose
  one of four options. Cook Cool, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material. Lift
  Slowly lift an unattended object of light Bulk or less 1 foot off the ground. Make
  Create a temporary object of negligible Bulk, made of congealed magical substance.
  The object looks crude and artificial and is extremely fragile-it can't be used
  as a tool, weapon, or spell component. Tidy Color, clean, or soil an object of light
  Bulk or less. You can affect an object of 1 Bulk with 10 rounds of concentration,
  and a larger object a 1 minute per Bulk. Prestidigitation can't deal damage or cause
  adverse conditions. Any actual change to an object (beyond what is noted above)
  persists only as long as you Sustain the Spell.
