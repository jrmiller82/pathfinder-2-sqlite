descr: "Opening a door that bypasses normal space, you instantly transport yourself\
  \ and any items you're wearing and holding from your current space to a clear space\
  \ within range you can see. If this would bring another creature with you-even if\
  \ you're carrying it in an extradimensional container-the spell is lost.  \n\n---\n\
  **Heightened (5th)**  The range increases to 1 mile. You don't need to be able to\
  \ see your destination, as long as you have been there in the past and know its\
  \ relative location and distance from you. You are temporarily immune for 1 hour."
