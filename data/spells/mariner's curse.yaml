descr: "You afflict the target with the curse of the roiling, unforgiving sea. The\
  \ target must attempt a Will save.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The target is unaffected.\
  \  \n\n**Success**  The target becomes sickened 1. Reducing its sickened condition\
  \ to 0 ends the curse.  \n\n**Failure**  The target becomes sickened 1 and can't\
  \ reduce its sickened condition below 1 while the curse remains. The curse can be\
  \ lifted by *remove curse* or similar magic. Whenever the target is sickened and\
  \ on the water at least a mile from shore, it is also slowed 1.  \n\n**Critical\
  \ Failure**  As failure, but the target becomes sickened 2."
