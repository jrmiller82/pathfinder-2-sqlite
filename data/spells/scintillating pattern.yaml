descr: "A field of cascading, ever-changing colors manifests in the air. Creatures\
  \ are dazzled while inside the pattern, as are those within 20 feet of the pattern's\
  \ area. A creature must attempt a Will save if it is inside the pattern when you\
  \ cast it, enters the pattern, ends its turn within the pattern, or uses a Seek\
  \ or Interact action on the pattern. A creature currently affected by the pattern\
  \ doesn't need to attempt new saves.  \n\n**Success**  The creature is unaffected.\
  \  \n\n**Failure**  The creature is confused for 1d4 rounds.  \n\n**Critical Failure**\
  \  The creature is stunned for 1d4 rounds. After the stunned condition ends, the\
  \ creature is confused for the remaining duration of the spell."
