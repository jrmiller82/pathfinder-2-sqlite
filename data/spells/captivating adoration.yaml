descr: "You become intensely entrancing, and creatures are distracted by you as long\
  \ as they remain within the area. You can exclude any creatures you choose from\
  \ the effects. \n\nWhen a creature enters the area for the first time, it must attempt\
  \ a Will saving throw. If a creature leaves and reenters, it uses the results of\
  \ its original save.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The creature is unaffected and temporarily\
  \ immune for 1 hour.  \n\n**Success**  The creature is fascinated with you for its\
  \ next action, then is temporarily immune for 1 hour.  \n\n**Failure**  The creature\
  \ is fascinated with you.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  The creature is fascinated\
  \ with you, and its attitude toward you improves by one step.  \n\n---\n**Heightened\
