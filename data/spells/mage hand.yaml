  \ the object, you can move it in any direction. When you Sustain the Spell, you\
  \ can move the object an additional 20 feet. If the object is in the air when the\
  \ spell ends, the object falls.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (3rd)**  You can target an\
  \ unattended object with a Bulk of 1 or less.  \n\n**Heightened (5th)**  The range\
  \ increases to 60 feet, and you can target an unattended object with a Bulk of 1\
  \ or less.  \n\n**Heightened (7th)**  The range increases to 60 feet, and you can\
  \ target an unattended object with a Bulk of 2 or less."
