descr: "You ward an area to alert you when creatures enter without your permission.\
  \ When you cast alarm, select a password. Whenever a Small or larger corporeal creature\
  \ enters the spell's area without speaking the password, alarm sends your choice\
  \ of a mental alert (in which case the spell gains the mental trait) or an audible\
  \ alarm with the sound and volume of a hand bell (in which case the spell gains\
  \ the auditory trait). Either option automatically awakens you, and the bell allows\
  \ each creature in the area to attempt a DC 15 Perception check to wake up. A creature\
  \ aware of the alarm must succeed at a Stealth check against the spell's DC or trigger\
  \ the spell when moving into the area.  \n\n**Heightened (3rd)**  You can specify\
  \ criteria for which creatures sound the alarm spell-for instance, orcs or masked\
  \ people."
