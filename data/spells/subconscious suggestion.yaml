descr: "You implant a subconscious suggestion deep within the target's mind for them\
  \ to follow when a trigger you specify occurs (as described on page 305). You suggest\
  \ a course of action to the target. Your directive must be phrased in such a way\
  \ as to seem like a logical course of action to the target, and it can't be self-destructive\
  \ or obviously against the target's self-interest. The target must attempt a Will\
  \ save.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The target is unaffected and knows you tried\
  \ to control it.  \n\n**Success**  The target is unaffected and thinks you were\
  \ talking to them normally, not casting a spell on them.  \n\n**Failure**  The suggestion\
  \ remains in the target's subconscious until the next time you prepare. If the trigger\
  \ occurs before then, the target immediately follows your suggestion. The effect\
  \ has a duration of 1 minute, or until the target has completed a finite suggestion\
  \ or the suggestion becomes self-destructive or has other obvious negative effects.\
  \  \n\n**Critical Failure**  As failure, but the duration is 1 hour.  \n\n**Heightened\
  \ (9th)**  You can target up to 10 creatures."
