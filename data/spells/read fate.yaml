descr: "You attempt to learn more about the target's fate in the short term, usually\
  \ within the next day for most prosaic creatures, or the next hour or less for someone\
  \ likely to have multiple rapid experiences, such as someone actively adventuring.\
  \ \n\nYou learn a single enigmatic word connected to the creature's fate in that\
  \ time frame. Fate is notoriously inscrutable, and the word isn't necessarily meant\
  \ to be taken at face value, so the meaning is often clear only in hindsight. The\
  \ GM rolls a secret DC 6 flat check. If the creature's fate is too uncertain, or\
  \ on a failed flat check, the spell yields the word \"inconclusive.\" Either way,\
  \ the creature is then temporarily immune for 24 hours."
