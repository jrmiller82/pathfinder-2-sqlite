descr: You hurl a held melee weapon with which you are trained at the target, making
  a spell attack roll. On a success, you deal the weapon's damage as if you had hit
  with a melee Strike, but adding your spellcasting ability modifier to damage, rather
  than your Strength modifier. On a critical success, you deal double damage, and
  you add the weapon's critical specialization effect. Regardless of the outcome,
  the weapon flies back to you and returns to your hand.
