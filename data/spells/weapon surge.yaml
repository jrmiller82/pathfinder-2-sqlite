descr: 'Holding your weapon aloft, you fill it with divine energy. On your next Strike
  with that weapon before the start of your next turn, you gain a +1 status bonus
  to the attack roll and the weapon deals an additional die of damage. If the weapon
  has a *striking* rune, this instead increases the number of dice from the *striking*
  rune by 1 (to a maximum of 3 extra weapon dice).


  If the target weapon leaves your possession, *weapon surge* immediately ends.'
