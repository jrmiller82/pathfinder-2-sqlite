descr: "You create a brief vision of immense wealth filling the spell's area. Each\
  \ creature within 20 feet of the area that could be enticed by material wealth must\
  \ attempt a Will saving throw. A creature that enters the area automatically disbelieves\
  \ the illusion, and disbelieving the illusion ends any fascinated condition imposed\
  \ by the spell. As long as you Sustain the Spell, other creatures react to the treasure\
  \ like they would any other illusion, but they are not at risk of becoming fascinated.\
  \  \n\n**Critical Success**  The creature disbelieves the illusion and is unaffected\
  \ by it.  \n\n**Success**  The creature is fascinated by the wealth until it has\
  \ completed its first action on its next turn.  \n\n**Failure**  The creature is\
  \ fascinated by the illusion."
