  \ allies recently threatened it or used hostile actions against it.You can Dismiss\
  \ the spell. If you use hostile actions against the target, the spell ends. When\
  \ the spell ends, the target doesn't necessarily realize it was charmed unless its\
  \ friendship with you or the actions you convinced it to take clash with its expectations,\
  \ meaning you could potentially convince the target to continue being your friend\
  \ via mundane means.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The target is unaffected and aware\
  \ you tried to charm it.  \n\n**Success**  The target is unaffected but thinks your\
  \ spell was something harmless instead of charm, unless it identifies the spell\
  \ (see Identifying Magic).  \n\n**Failure**  The target's attitude becomes friendly\
  \ toward you. If it was friendly, it becomes helpful. It can't use hostile actions\
  \ against you.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  The target's attitude becomes helpful\
  \ toward you, and it can't use hostile actions against you.  \n\n---\n**Heightened\
