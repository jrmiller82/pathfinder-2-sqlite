descr: "To the target, your words are honey and your visage seems bathed in a dreamy\
  \ haze. It must attempt a Will save, with a +4 circumstance bonus if you or your\
  \ allies recently threatened it or used hostile actions against it. You can Dismiss\
  \ the spell. If you use hostile actions against the target, the spell ends. When\
  \ the spell ends, the target doesn't necessarily realize it was charmed unless its\
  \ friendship with you or the actions you convinced it to take clash with its expectations,\
  \ meaning you could potentially convince the target to continue being your friend\
  \ via mundane means.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The target is unaffected and aware\
  \ you tried to charm it.  \n\n**Success**  The target is unaffected but thinks your\
  \ spell was something harmless instead of charm, unless it identifies the spell\
  \ (usually with Identify Magic).  \n\n**Failure**  The target's attitude becomes\
  \ friendly toward you. If it was friendly, it becomes helpful. It can't use hostile\
  \ actions against you.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  The target's attitude becomes\
  \ helpful toward you, and it can't use hostile actions against you.  \n\n**Heightened\
  \ (+4)**  The duration lasts until the next time you make your daily preparations.\
  \  \n\n**Heightened (+8)**  The duration lasts until the next time you make your\
  \ daily preparations, and you can target up to 10 creatures."
