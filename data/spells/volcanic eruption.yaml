descr: "The ground opens up, spraying a column of lava high into the air in a vertical\
  \ cylinder, dealing 14d6 fire damage to creatures in the area. The lava rapidly\
  \ cools and encases creatures in the area. A creature encased in rock is clumsy\
  \ 1 and takes a -10-foot status penalty to its Speeds. All normal terrain is difficult\
  \ terrain to a flying creature, and such creatures immediately descend 20 feet the\
  \ moment they're encased, but they don't take damage from this fall. A creature\
  \ encased in rock can attempt to Escape against your spell DC to end the effect.\
  \ Otherwise, the creature remains encased until it takes a total of 50 damage, freeing\
  \ it from the rock. \n\nAdditionally, creatures in the area and those within 5 feet\
  \ of the lava column automatically take 3d6 fire damage from the intense heat, regardless\
  \ of the results of their saving throws.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The creature\
  \ is unaffected.  \n\n**Success**  The creature takes half damage.  \n\n**Failure**\
  \  The creature takes full damage and is encased.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  The\
  \ creature takes double damage and is encased.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (+1)**  The\
  \ damage in the area increases by 2d6, and the damage from the intense heat increases\
  \ by 1d6."
