descr: "You create an illusory visual image of a stationary object. The entire image\
  \ must fit within the spell's area. The object appears to animate naturally, but\
  \ it doesn't make sounds or generate smells. For example, water would appear to\
  \ pour down an illusory waterfall, but it would be silent. Any creature that touches\
  \ the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your\
  \ illusion.  \n\n**Heightened (2nd)**  Your image makes appropriate sounds, generates\
  \ normal smells, and feels right to the touch. The spell gains the auditory trait.\
  \ The duration increases to 1 hour.  \n\n**Heightened (5th)**  As the 2nd-level\
  \ version, but the duration is unlimited."
