descr: "You shoot a blazing ray of light tinged with holy energy. Make a ranged spell\
  \ attack. The ray deals 5d6 fire damage. If the target is a fiend or undead, you\
  \ deal an extra 5d6 good damage. \n\n**Critical Success**  The target takes double\
  \ fire damage, as well as double good damage if a fiend or undead.  \n\n**Success**\
  \  The target takes full damage  \n\nIf the light passes through an area of magical\
  \ darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, *searing light* attempts\
  \ to counteract the darkness. If you need to determine whether the light passes\
  \ through an area of darkness, draw a line between yourself and the spell's target\
  \  \n\n---\n**Heightened (+1)**  The fire damage increases by 2d6, and the good\
  \ damage against fiends and undead increases by 2d6."
