descr: Falsehoods pass your lips as smoothly as silk. You gain a +4 status bonus to
  Deception checks to Lie and against Perception checks to discern if you are telling
  the truth, and you add your level even if you're untrained. If the implausibility
  of your lies prompts a circumstance penalty or a DC increase, reduce that penalty
  or increase by half.
