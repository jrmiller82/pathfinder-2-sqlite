descr: "You sculpt a barrier of ice that blocks sight and, once shattered, freezes\
  \ foes. You create either a 1-foot-thick wall of ice in a straight line up to 60\
  \ feet long and 10 feet high (the wall doesn't have to be vertical, but it must\
  \ be anchored on both sides to a solid surface) or a 1-foot-thick, 10-foot radius\
  \ hemisphere of ice. The ice that makes up the wall is opaque. If you wish, the\
  \ wall can be of a smaller length, height, or radius. You must create the wall in\
  \ an unbroken open space so its edges don't pass through any creatures or objects,\
  \ or the spell is lost. \n\nEach 10-foot-by-10-foot section of the wall has AC 10,\
  \ Hardness 10, and 40 Hit Points, and it's immune to critical hits, cold damage,\
  \ and precision damage. A section also has weakness to fire 15; a section of the\
  \ wall destroyed by fire melts, evaporating into water and steam. A section destroyed\
  \ by means other than fire leaves behind a chilling mass of ice that is difficult\
  \ terrain and deals 2d6 cold damage to any creature passing through it.  \n\n---\n\
  **Heightened (+2)**  The Hit Points of each section of the wall increase by 10,\
  \ and the cold damage dealt to creatures crossing a destroyed section increases\
  \ by 1d6."
