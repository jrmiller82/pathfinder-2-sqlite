descr: You reverse gravity in the area. Creatures and objects that aren't secured
  to the ground immediately fall upward to the top of the area. A creature might be
  able to Grab an Edge to arrest its fall if it falls past an appropriate surface.
  If a creature falls against a solid object (such as a ceiling), it takes the appropriate
  amount of falling damage and lands on the surface. Once an object or creature reaches
  the top of the area, it floats, caught between the normal and reversed gravity.
  The creature can move along the plane where the two forms of gravity meet. Creatures
  that can levitate or fly can use those abilities to mitigate the effects of reverse
  gravity.When reverse gravity ends, all creatures and objects caught in the area
  fall back down. Likewise, anything that moves beyond the spell's area is subjected
  to normal gravity again.
