descr: "Siphoning negative energy into yourself, your hand radiates a pale darkness.\
  \ Your touch weakens the living and disorients undead, possibly even causing them\
  \ to flee. The effect depends on whether the target is living or undead. Living\
  \ Creature The spell deals negative damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting modifier.\
  \ The target attempts a basic Fortitude save, but is also enfeebled 1 for 1 round\
  \ on a critical failure. Undead Creature The target is flat-footed for 1 round on\
  \ a failed Fortitude save. On a critical failure, the target is also fleeing for\
  \ 1 round unless it succeeds at a Will save.  \n\n**Heightened (+1)**  The negative\
  \ damage to living creatures increases by 1d4."
