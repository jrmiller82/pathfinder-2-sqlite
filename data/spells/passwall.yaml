descr: "You create a visible tunnel through the wall in the chosen area, replacing\
  \ the area with empty space. If the wall is thicker than 10 feet, the tunnel ends\
  \ 10 feet in. Even a small layer of metal in the wall prevents this spell from functioning.\
  \ This spell doesn't reduce the integrity of the structure. When the spell ends,\
  \ anyone inside the tunnel is shunted to the nearest exit.  \n\n---\n**Heightened\
  \ (7th)**  The tunnel can be up to 20 feet deep. The areas of the wall that contain\
  \ your tunnel's entrance appear completely normal (unless viewed with *true seeing*\
  \ or a similar effect), despite the tunnel's existence. The tunnel's entrance functions\
  \ as a solid wall, but you can specify a password or a trigger, allowing creatures\
  \ to enter the tunnel freely."
