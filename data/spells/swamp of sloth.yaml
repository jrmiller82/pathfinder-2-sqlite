descr: "Ground in the area turns swampy and fetid. The area is difficult terrain.\
  \ The sludge at the bottom of the morass animates into diminutive sludge beasts\
  \ that have a demonic appearance. These don't function as normal creatures, but\
  \ they swarm over creatures in the swamp and exude a noxious stench. The swamp deals\
  \ 1d6 poison damage; creatures that end their turn in the area must attempt a basic\
  \ Fortitude save. You can increase the number of actions it takes to Cast the Spell.\
  \ For each additional action, increase the burst's radius by 5 feet.  \n\n**Heightened\
  \ (+2)**  The damage increases by 1d6, and the initial radius increases by 5 feet."
