descr: "You create a pattern of shifting colors that hovers in the air in a geometric\
  \ cloud. Creatures are dazzled while inside the pattern. In addition, a creature\
  \ must attempt a Will saving throw if it is inside the pattern when you cast it,\
  \ when it enters the pattern, when it ends its turn within the pattern, or if it\
  \ uses a Seek or Interact action on the pattern. A creature currently fascinated\
  \ by the pattern doesn't attempt new saves.  \n\n**Success**  The target is unaffected.\
  \  \n\n**Failure**  The target is fascinated by the pattern.  \n\n**Critical Failure**\
  \  The target is fascinated by the pattern. While it remains fascinated, it can't\
  \ use reactions."
