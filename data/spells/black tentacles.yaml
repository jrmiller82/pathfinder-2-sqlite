descr: Oily black tentacles rise up and attempt to Grapple each creature in the area.
  Make spell attack rolls against the Fortitude DC of each creature. Any creature
  you succeed against is grabbed and takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage. Whenever a creature
  ends its turn in the area, the tentacles attempt to grab that creature if they haven't
  already, and they deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage to any creature already grabbed. The
  tentacles' Escape DC is equal to your spell DC. A creature can attack a tentacle
  in an attempt to release its grip. Its AC is equal to your spell DC, and it is destroyed
  if it takes 12 or more damage. Even if destroyed, additional tentacles continue
  to grow in the area until the duration ends. You can Dismiss the spell.
