descr: You conjure grease, with effects based on choosing area or target. Area All
  solid ground in the area is covered with grease. Each creature standing on the greasy
  surface must succeed at a Reflex save or an Acrobatics check against your spell
  DC or fall prone. Creatures using an action to move onto the greasy surface during
  the spell's duration must attempt either a Reflex save or an Acrobatics check to
  Balance. A creature that Steps or Crawls doesn't have to attempt a check or save.
  Target If you cast the spell on an unattended object, anyone trying to pick up the
  object must succeed at an Acrobatics check or Reflex save against your spell DC
  to do so. If you target an attended object, the creature that has the object must
  attempt an Acrobatics check or Reflex save. On a failure, the holder or wielder
  takes a -2 circumstance penalty to all checks that involve using the object; on
  a critical failure, the holder or wielder releases the item. The object lands in
  an adjacent square of the GM's choice. If you cast this spell on a worn object,
  the wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves against attempts to
  grapple them.
