descr: "You punish a creature that transgresses against your deity, drawing upon the\
  \ anguish you feel upon seeing one of your deity's anathema committed. You can cast\
  \ this spell only when a creature actively commits a unique act of anathema. For\
  \ example, if creating undead were anathema to your deity, you could use anathematic\
  \ reprisal on a necromancer who had just created undead in front of you, but not\
  \ on an undead creature just for existing. You deal 4d6 mental damage to the target,\
  \ but a basic Will save can reduce this damage. If it fails, it is also stupefied\
  \ 1 for 1 round. The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.  \n\n**Heightened\
  \ (+1)**  The damage increases by 1d6."
