  \ the food, it decays and becomes inedible. Most Small creatures eat one-quarter\
  \ as much as a Medium creature (one-sixteenth as much for most Tiny creatures),\
  \ and most Large creatures eat 10 times as much (100 times as much for Huge creatures\
  \ and so on).  \n\n---\n**Heightened (4th)**  You can feed 12 Medium creatures.\
  \  \n\n**Heightened (6th)**  You can feed 50 Medium creatures.  \n\n**Heightened\
  \ (8th)**  You can feed 200 Medium creatures."
