descr: "Cloaked in illusion, the target becomes invisible. This makes it undetected\
  \ to all creatures, though the creatures can attempt to find the target, making\
  \ it hidden to them instead (page 466). If the target uses a hostile action, the\
  \ spell ends after that hostile action is completed.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (4th)**\
  \  The spell lasts 1 minute, but it doesn't end if the target uses a hostile action."
