descr: "You raise a blazing wall that burns creatures passing through it. You create\
  \ either a 5-foot-thick wall of flame in a straight line up to 60 feet long and\
  \ 10 feet high, or a 5-foot-thick, 10-foot-radius ring of flame with the same height.\
  \ The wall stands vertically in either form; if you wish, the wall can be of a shorter\
  \ length or height. Everything on each side of the wall is concealed from creatures\
  \ on the opposite side. Any creature that crosses the wall or is occupying the wall's\
  \ area at the start of its turn takes 4d6 fire damage.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (+1)**\
  \  The fire damage increases by 1d6."
