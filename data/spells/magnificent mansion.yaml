descr: "You conjure an extradimensional demiplane consisting of a spacious dwelling\
  \ with a single entrance. The entrance connects to the plane where you Cast the\
  \ Spell, appearing anywhere within the spell's range as a faint, shimmering, vertical\
  \ rectangle 5 feet wide and 10 feet high. You designate who can enter when you cast\
  \ the spell. Once inside, you can shut the entrance, making it invisible. You and\
  \ the creatures you designated can reopen the door at will, just like opening a\
  \ physical door. \n\nInside, the demiplane appears to be a mansion featuring a magnificent\
  \ foyer and numerous opulent chambers. The mansion can have any floor plan you imagine\
  \ as you Cast the Spell, provided it fits within a space 40 feet wide, 40 feet deep,\
  \ and 30 feet tall. While the entrance to the mansion is closed, effects from outside\
  \ the mansion fail to penetrate it, and vice versa, except for *plane shift*, which\
  \ can be used to enter the mansion. You can use scrying magic and similar effects\
  \ to observe the outside only if they're capable of crossing planes. \n\nA staff\
  \ of up to 24 servants attends to anyone within the mansion. These are like the\
  \ servant created by the *unseen servant* spell, though they're visible, with an\
  \ appearance you determine during casting. The mansion is stocked with enough food\
  \ to serve a nine-course banquet to 150 people."
