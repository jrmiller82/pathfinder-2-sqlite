descr: 'Your encouragement inspires your ally to succeed at a task. This counts as
  having taken sufficient preparatory actions to Aid your ally on a skill check of
  your choice, regardless of the circumstances. When you later use the Aid reaction,
  you can roll Performance instead of the normal skill check, and if you roll a failure,
  you get a success instead. If you are legendary in Performance, you automatically
  critically succeed.


  The GM might rule that you can''t use this ability if the act of encouraging your
  ally would interfere with the skill check (such as a check to Sneak quietly or maintain
  a disguise).'
