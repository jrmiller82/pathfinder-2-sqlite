descr: "The target makes no sound, preventing creatures from noticing it using hearing\
  \ or other senses alone. The target can't use sonic attacks, nor can it use actions\
  \ with the auditory trait. This prevents it from casting spells that include verbal\
  \ components.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (4th)**  The spell effect emanates from the\
  \ touched creature, silencing all sound in or passing through a 10- foot radius\
  \ and preventing any auditory and sonic effects in the affected area. While within\
  \ the radius, creatures are subject to the same effects as the target. Depending\
  \ upon the position of the effect, a creature might notice the lack of sound reaching\
  \ it (blocking off the noise coming from a party, for example)."
