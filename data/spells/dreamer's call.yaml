descr: "The target becomes distracted and suggestible, inundated by vivid daydreams.\
  \  \n\n**Critical Success**  The target is unaffected.  \n\n**Success**  The target's\
  \ attention wavers. It becomes flat-footed and fascinated by its daydreams.  \n\n\
  **Failure**  As success, except that you appear in the dream and give a suggestion.\
  \ This can be to approach you, run away (as if it had the fleeing condition), Release\
  \ what it's holding, Drop Prone, or stand in place. The creature follows this course\
  \ of action as its first action after you Cast the Spell.  \n\n**Critical Failure**\
  \  As failure, but the target follows the course of action for as many actions as\
  \ possible for the spell's duration, and it does nothing else."
