descr: "Three illusory images of you swirl about your space, potentially causing those\
  \ who attack you to hit one of the images instead of you. Any attack that would\
  \ hit you has a random chance of hitting one of your images instead of you. If all\
  \ three images remain, there is a 1 in 4 chance of hitting you (1 on 1d4). With\
  \ two images remaining, there is a 1 in 3 chance of hitting you (1-2 on 1d6). With\
  \ only one image, the chances are 1 in 2 (1-3 on 1d6). \n\nOnce an image is hit,\
  \ it is destroyed. If an attack roll fails to hit your AC but doesn't critically\
  \ fail, it destroys an image but has no additional effect (even if the attack would\
  \ normally have an effect on a failure). If an attack roll is a critical success\
  \ and would hit one of the images, one of the images is destroyed and the attack\
  \ roll becomes a success against you. Once all the images are destroyed, the spell\
  \ ends."
