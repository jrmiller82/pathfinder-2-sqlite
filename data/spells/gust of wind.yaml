descr: "A violent wind issues forth from your palm, blowing from the point where you\
  \ are when you cast the spell to the line's opposite end. The wind extinguishes\
  \ small non-magical fires, disperses fog and mist, blows objects of light Bulk or\
  \ less around, and pushes larger objects. Large or smaller creatures in the area\
  \ must attempt a Fortitude save. Large or smaller creatures that later move into\
  \ the gust must attempt the save on entering.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The creature\
  \ is unaffected.  \n\n**Success**  The creature can't move against the wind.  \n\
  \n**Failure**  The creature is knocked prone. If it was flying, it suffers the effects\
  \ of critical failure instead.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  The creature is pushed\
  \ 30 feet in the wind's direction, knocked prone, and takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage."
