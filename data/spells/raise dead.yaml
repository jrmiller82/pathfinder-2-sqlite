descr: "You attempt to call forth the dead creature's soul, requiring the creature's\
  \ body to be present and relatively intact. The creature must have died within the\
  \ past 3 days. If Pharasma has decided that the creature's time has come (at the\
  \ GM's discretion), or if the creature doesn't wish to return to life, this spell\
  \ automatically fails, but the diamonds aren't consumed in the casting. \n\nIf the\
  \ spell is successful, the creature returns to life with 1 Hit Point, no spells\
  \ prepared or spell slots available, no points in any pools or any other daily resources,\
  \ and still with any long-term debilitations of the old body. The time spent in\
  \ the Boneyard leaves the target temporarily debilitated, making it clumsy 2, drained\
  \ 2, and enfeebled 2 for 1 week; these conditions can't be removed or reduced by\
  \ any means until the week has passed. The creature is also permanently changed\
  \ by its time in the afterlife, such as a slight personality shift, a streak of\
  \ white in the hair, or a strange new birthmark.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (7th)**\
  \  The maximum level of the target increases to 15. The cost increases to the target's\
  \ level (minimum 1) x 400 gp.  \n\n**Heightened (8th)**  The maximum level the target\
  \ increases to 17. The cost increases to the target's level (minimum 1) x 800 gp.\
  \  \n\n**Heightened (9th)**  The maximum level of the target increases to 19. The\
  \ cost increases to the target's level (minimum 1) x 1,600 gp.  \n\n**Heightened\
  \ (10th)**  The maximum level the target increases to 21. The cost increases to\
  \ the target's level (minimum 1) x 3,200 gp."
