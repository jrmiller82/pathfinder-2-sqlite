descr: "You take command of the target, forcing it to obey your orders. If you issue\
  \ an obviously self-destructive order, the target doesn't act until you issue a\
  \ new order. The effect depends on its Will save.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The\
  \ target is unaffected.  \n\n**Success**  The target is stunned 1 as it fights off\
  \ your commands.  \n\n**Failure**  The target follows your orders but can attempt\
  \ a Will save at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the spell ends.  \n\
  \n**Critical Failure**  As a failure, but the target receives a new save only if\
  \ you give it a new order that is against its nature, such as killing its allies.\
  \  \n\n---\n**Heightened (10th)**  The duration is unlimited."
duration: until the next time you make your daily preparations
