description: "You channel positive energy to heal the living or damage the undead.\
  \ If the target is a willing living creature, you restore 1d8 Hit Points. If the\
  \ target is undead, you deal that amount of positive damage to it, and it gets a\
  \ basic Fortitude save. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell\
  \ determines its targets, range, area, and other parameters.  \n\n  \n\n |1| (somatic)\
  \ The spell has a range of touch.  \n\n |2| (verbal, somatic) The spell has a range\
  \ of 30 feet. If you're healing a living creature, increase the Hit Points restored\
  \ by 8.  \n\n |3| (material, somatic, verbal) You disperse positive energy in a\
  \ 30-foot emanation. This targets all living and undead creatures in the burst.\
  \  \n\n**Heightened (+1)**  The amount of healing or damage increases by 1d8, and\
  \ the extra healing for the 2-action version increases by 8."
