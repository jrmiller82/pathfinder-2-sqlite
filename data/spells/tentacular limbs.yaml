descr: "Your arms turn into long, pliable tentacles, increasing your reach when you're\
  \ delivering touch range spells and making unarmed Strikes with your arms (such\
  \ as fist and claw Strikes) to 10 feet. This doesn't change the reach of your melee\
  \ weapon attacks. During the duration, whenever you Cast a Spell, you can add an\
  \ additional action to that spell's casting to temporarily extend your reach to\
  \ 20 feet to deliver that spell.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (+2)**  When you add an\
  \ additional action to a spell to temporarily extend your reach, your reach increases\
  \ by an additional 10 feet to deliver that spell."
