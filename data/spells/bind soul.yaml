descr: "You wrench the target's soul away before it can pass on to the afterlife and\
  \ imprison it in a black sapphire. \n\nWhile the soul is in the gem, the target\
  \ can't be returned to life through any means, even powerful magic such as *wish*.\
  \ If the gem is destroyed or *bind soul* is counteracted on the gem, the soul is\
  \ freed. The gem has AC 16 and Hardness 10. A gem can't hold more than one soul,\
  \ and any attempt wastes the spell."
