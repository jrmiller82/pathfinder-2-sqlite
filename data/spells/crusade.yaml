descr: "You issue a divine mandate to the targets. you pronounce a cause. It can be\
  \ to attain an item, claim a patch of land, slay a creature, war with a group, or\
  \ be entirely peaceful. Your cause can't force the targets to harm one another or\
  \ themselves. The targets become completely dedicated to that cause, depending on\
  \ their levels. They choose their own actions, but they favor direct action over\
  \ inaction or indirect action. \n\n* **13th or Lower** The target is so dedicated\
  \ to the cause that it pursues the cause to the death (unless you say otherwise).\
  \ \n\n* **14th** The target is dedicated to the cause, but the spell ends for the\
  \ target if it's reduced to half its maximum Hit Points or fewer.  \n\n* **15th**\
  \ As 14th, plus the target can attempt a Will save at the end of each of its turns\
  \ to end the spell for itself. \n\nThe spell ends for all creatures if you or one\
  \ of your allies uses a hostile action against a target, or when the cause is completed.\
  \ The GM might determine this spell has alignment traits befitting the cause.  \n\
  \n---\n**Heightened (10th)**  The level for each category increases by 2."
