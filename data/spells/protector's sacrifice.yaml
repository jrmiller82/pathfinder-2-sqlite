descr: "You protect your ally by suffering in their stead. Reduce the damage the triggering\
  \ ally would take by 3. You redirect this damage to yourself, but your immunities,\
  \ weaknesses, resistances and so on do not apply. \n\nYou aren't subject to any\
  \ conditions or other effects of whatever damaged your ally (such as poison from\
  \ a venomous bite). Your ally is still subject to those effects even if you redirect\
  \ all of the triggering damage to yourself.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (+1)**  The damage\
  \ you redirect increases by 3."
