descr: "You protect your ally by suffering in their stead. Reduce the damage the triggering\
  \ ally would take by 3. You redirect this damage to yourself, but your immunities,\
  \ weaknesses, resistances and so on do not apply. You aren't subject to any conditions\
  \ or other effects of whatever damaged your ally (such as poison from a venomous\
  \ bite). Your ally is still subject to those effects even if you redirect all of\
  \ the triggering damage to yourself.  \n\n**Heightened (+1)**  The damage you redirect\
  \ increases by 3."
