descr: "You alter the appearance of an item's magic aura. You can choose to have the\
  \ target's aura appear as that of common magic item of twice *magic aura*'s level\
  \ or lower, or to have it register as being under the effects of a spell of your\
  \ choice of *magic aura*'s level or lower. If the target is magical, you can instead\
  \ choose to have it appear as entirely non-magical. \n\nA caster using *detect magic*\
  \ or *study aura* of an equal or higher spell level can attempt to disbelieve the\
  \ illusion from *magic aura*. *Magic aura* doesn't mask the aura of spells that\
  \ are 9th level or higher or of items that are 19th level or higher.  \n\n---\n\
  **Heightened (3rd)**  You can target a creature instead of an object. When you do,\
  \ you can either conceal the auras of all magic items it has or have that creature's\
  \ aura appear as if it were under the effect of a spell you know."
