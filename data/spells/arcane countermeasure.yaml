descr: "You undermine the target spell, making it easier to defend against. You reduce\
  \ the spell's level by 1, and targets of the spell gain a +2 status bonus to any\
  \ saving throws, skill checks, AC, or DC against it. \n\nYou can't reduce the spell's\
  \ level below its minimum. For example, a 5th-level *cone of cold* would remain\
  \ 5th-level, but a 5th-level *fireball* would become 4th-level. Targets still gain\
  \ all the other benefits, even if you don't reduce the spell's level."
