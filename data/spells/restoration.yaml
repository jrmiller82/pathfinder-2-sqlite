descr: "Restorative magic counters the effects of toxins or conditions that prevent\
  \ a creature from functioning at its best. When you cast *restoration*, choose to\
  \ either reduce a condition or lessen the effect of a toxin. A creature can benefit\
  \ from only one *restoration* spell each day, and it can't benefit from *restoration*\
  \ more than once to reduce the stage of the same exposure to a given toxin.\n\n\
  * **Reduce a Condition** Reduce the value of the target's clumsy, enfeebled, or\
  \ stupefied condition by 2. You can instead reduce two of the listed conditions\
  \ by 1 each.  \n\n* **Lessen a Toxin** Reduce the stage of one toxin the target\
  \ suffers from by one stage. This can't reduce the stage below stage 1 or cure the\
  \ affliction.\n\n---\n**Heightened (4th)**  Add drained to the list of conditions\
  \ you can reduce. When you lessen a toxin, reduce the stage by two. You also gain\
  \ a third option that allows you to reduce the target's doomed value by 1. You can't\
  \ use this to reduce a permanent doomed condition.  \n\n**Heightened (6th)**  As\
  \ the 4th-level *restoration*, but you can reduce a permanent doomed condition if\
  \ you add a spellcasting action and a material component while Casting the Spell,\
  \ during which you provide 100 gp worth of diamond dust as a cost."
