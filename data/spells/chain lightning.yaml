descr: "You discharge a powerful bolt of lightning at the target, dealing 8d12 electricity\
  \ damage. The target must attempt a basic Reflex save. The electricity arcs to another\
  \ creature within 30 feet of the first target, jumps to another creature within\
  \ 30 feet of that target, and so on. You can end the chain at any point. You can't\
  \ target the same creature more than once, and you must have line of effect to all\
  \ targets. Roll the damage only once, and apply it to each target (halving or doubling\
  \ as appropriate for its saving throw outcome). The chain ends if any one of the\
  \ targets critically succeeds at its save.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (+1)**  The damage\
  \ increases by 1d12."
