descr: "You try to turn the target's flesh into stone. The target must attempt a Fortitude\
  \ save.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The target is unaffected.  \n\n**Success**  The\
  \ target is slowed 1 for 1 round.  \n\n**Failure**  The target is slowed 1 and must\
  \ attempt a Fortitude save at the end of each of its turns; this ongoing save has\
  \ the incapacitation trait. On a failed save, the slowed condition increases by\
  \ 1 (or 2 on a critical failure). A successful save reduces the slowed condition\
  \ by 1. When a creature is unable to act due to the slowed condition from *flesh\
  \ to stone*, the creature is petrified permanently. The spell ends if the creature\
  \ is petrified or the slowed condition is removed.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  As\
  \ failure, but the target is initially slowed 2."
