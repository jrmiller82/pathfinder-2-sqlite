descr: "You try to create a temporary duplicate of an enemy to fight on your behalf.\
  \ The target can attempt a Fortitude save to disrupt the spell. The duplicate appears\
  \ in an unoccupied space adjacent to the target and has the target's attack modifier,\
  \ AC, saving throw modifiers, Perception, and skill modifiers, but it has only 70\
  \ Hit Points and lacks the target's special abilities, including immunities, resistances,\
  \ and weaknesses. It has no magic items except weapon potency runes. \n\nThe duplicate\
  \ gains the minion trait, and it can only Stride and Strike. Its Strikes deal the\
  \ target's normal damage but don't apply added effects, since it doesn't have special\
  \ abilities. The spell automatically ends if the duplicate's Hit Points drop to\
  \ 0. \n\nThe duplicate attacks your enemies to the best of its abilities. You can\
  \ also try to give it additional instructions; when you Sustain the Spell, you can\
  \ also Command a Minion as part of your action, but the GM determines whether the\
  \ duplicate follows your command. \n\nThe duplicate is unstable, so each turn after\
  \ it takes its actions, it loses 4d6 Hit Points. It's not a living creature, and\
  \ it can never regain its lost Hit Points in any way.  \n\n**Critical Success**\
  \  You fail to create a duplicate.  \n\n**Success**  The duplicate deals half damage\
  \ with its Strikes and the duration is reduced to a maximum of 2 rounds.  \n\n**Failure**\
  \  The duplicate works as described.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (+1)**  The level of\
  \ creature you can target increases by 2. The duplicate has 10 more HP."
