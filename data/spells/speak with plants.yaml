descr: You can ask questions of and receive answers from plants, but the spell doesn't
  make them more friendly or intelligent than normal. Most normal plants have a distinctive
  view of the world around them, so they don't recognize details about creatures or
  know anything about the world beyond their immediate vicinity. Cunning plant monsters
  are likely to be terse and evasive, while less intelligent ones often make inane
  comments.
