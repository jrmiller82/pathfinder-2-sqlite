descr: "Whenever you speak or make any other sound vocally, you can make your vocalization\
  \ seem to originate from somewhere else within 60 feet, and you can change that\
  \ apparent location freely as you vocalize. Any creature that hears the sound can\
  \ attempt to disbelieve your illusion.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (+2)**  The spell's\
  \ duration increases to 1 hour, and you can also change the tone, quality, and other\
  \ aspects of your  voice. Before a creature can attempt to disbelieve your illusion,\
  \ it must actively attempt a Perception check or otherwise use actions to interact\
  \ with the sound."
