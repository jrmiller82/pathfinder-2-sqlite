descr: You offer a gift of food, and an ordinary Tiny wild animal within range approaches
  to eat it. You imprint the image, direction, and distance of an obvious place or
  landmark well known to you within the animal. Optionally, you can attach a small
  object or note up to light Bulk to it. The animal does its best to reach the destination;
  if it makes it there, it waits nearby until the duration expires, allowing other
  nonhostile creatures to approach it and remove the attached object. If there are
  no Tiny wild animals in range, the spell is lost.
