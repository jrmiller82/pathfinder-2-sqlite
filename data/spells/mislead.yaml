descr: You turn yourself invisible and create an illusory duplicate of yourself. When
  you Sustain the Spell, you can mentally dictate a course of action for your duplicate
  to follow that round. Your duplicate acts as though it had your full number of actions,
  though it can't actually affect anything in the environment. Both the duplicate
  and your invisibility persist for the spell's duration. Performing a hostile action
  doesn't end mislead's invisibility, just like a 4th-level invisibility spell. A
  creature that determines the duplicate is an illusion doesn't necessarily know you're
  invisible, and one that can see your invisible form doesn't necessarily know your
  duplicate is an illusion. If you Cast a Spell, attack, or otherwise interact with
  another creature, as a part of that action you can attempt a Deception check against
  observers' Perception DCs to convince them your duplicate used that action. This
  doesn't fool anyone who's aware your duplicate is an illusion, nor does it work
  if the attack obviously couldn't have come from the duplicate. For instance, if
  you fired a ray, you could make it look like it came from the duplicate as long
  as the duplicate was positioned appropriately, but if you attacked with a sword
  and your duplicate was across the room from the target, your Deception check would
  automatically fail.
