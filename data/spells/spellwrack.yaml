descr: "You cause any spells cast on the target to spill out their energy in harmful\
  \ surges. The target must attempt a Will save.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The target\
  \ is unaffected.  \n\n**Success**  Whenever the target becomes affected by a spell\
  \ with a duration, the target takes 2d12 persistent force damage. Each time it takes\
  \ persistent force damage from *spellwrack*, it reduces the remaining duration of\
  \ spells affecting it by 1 round. Only a successful Arcana check against your spell\
  \ DC can help the target recover from the persistent damage; the curse and the persistent\
  \ damage end after 1 minute.  \n\n**Failure**  As success, but the curse and persistent\
  \ damage do not end on their own.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  As failure, but the\
  \ persistent force damage is 4d12."
