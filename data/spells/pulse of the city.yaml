descr: "You tap into the zeitgeist of the nearest settlement in range (if any). You\
  \ learn the name of the settlement, and you can utter a special word to learn a\
  \ brief summary of one significant event happening in the settlement. Choose one\
  \ of the following words, which indicates the type of people involved and type of\
  \ event you learn about. \n\n* **Wardens** city guards, barristers, and judges (criminal\
  \ reports, busts, changes in routines, legal trials) \n\n* **Titles** nobles and\
  \ politicians (high society weddings, elite soirees, political rallies) \n\n* **Masses**\
  \ common folk and merchants (gathering mobs, major sales) \n\nWhen uttering your\
  \ word, you can exclude events you already know about, whether you know about them\
  \ from this spell or from other experiences. If you *cast pulse of the city* again\
  \ within 24 hours, you can say \"echo\" instead of another word to get an update\
  \ on the event you learned about the last time you Cast the Spell. \n\n*Pulse of\
  \ the city* reveals only publicly available or observable information. You never\
  \ learn clandestine movements or other details people are specifically trying to\
  \ hide. The spell is also notoriously bad at overcoming magic meant to avoid detection;\
  \ it automatically fails to reveal information about events involving creatures,\
  \ places, or objects affected by spells that could prevent or counteract *pulse\
  \ of the city* (such as *nondetection*).  \n\n---\n**Heightened (5th)**  The range\
  \ increases to 100 miles."
