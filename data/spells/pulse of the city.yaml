descr: "You tap into the zeitgeist of the nearest settlement in range (if any). You\
  \ learn the name of the settlement, and you can utter a special word to learn a\
  \ brief summary of one significant event happening in the settlement. Choose one\
  \ of the following words, which indicates the type of people involved and type of\
  \ event you learn about. Wardens city guards, barristers, and judges (criminal reports,\
  \ busts, changes in routines, legal trials) Titles nobles and politicians (high\
  \ society weddings, elite soirees, political rallies) Masses common folk and merchants\
  \ (gathering mobs, major sales) When uttering your word, you can exclude events\
  \ you already know about, whether you know about them from this spell or from other\
  \ experiences. If you cast pulse of the city again within 24 hours, you can say\
  \ \"echo\" instead of another word to get an update on the event you learned about\
  \ the last time you Cast the Spell. Pulse of the city reveals only publicly available\
  \ or observable information. You never learn clandestine movements or other details\
  \ people are specifically trying to hide. The spell is also notoriously bad at overcoming\
  \ magic meant to avoid detection; it automatically fails to reveal information about\
  \ events involving creatures, places, or objects affected by spells that could prevent\
  \ or counteract pulse of the city (such as nondetection).  \n\n**Heightened (5th)**\
  \  The range increases to 100 miles."
