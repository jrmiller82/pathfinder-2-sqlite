descr: You create an invisible, floating eye, 1 inch in diameter, at a location you
  can see within 500 feet. It sees in all directions with your normal visual senses
  and continuously transmits what it sees to you. The first time you Sustain the Spell
  each round, you can either move the eye up to 30 feet, seeing only things in front
  of the eye, or move it up to 10 feet, seeing everything in all directions around
  it. There is no limit to how far from you the eye can move, but the spell ends immediately
  if you and the eye ever cease to be on the same plane of existence. You can attempt
  Seek actions through the eye if you want to attempt Perception checks with it. Any
  damage dealt to the eye destroys it and ends the spell.
