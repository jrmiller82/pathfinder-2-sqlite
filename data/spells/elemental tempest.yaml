- Verbal
descr: Your spellcasting surrounds you in a storm of elemental energy. If the next
  action you take is to Cast a Spell from your wizard spell slots that's an evocation
  spell dealing acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, a 10-foot emanation of energy
  surrounds you as you cast the spell. Foes in the area take 1d6 damage per spell
  level of the spell you just cast of the same damage type the spell deals (choose
  one if it deals multiple types). Combine the damage from both elemental tempest
  and the other spell against foes who take damage from both before applying bonuses,
  penalties, resistance, weakness, and the like.
