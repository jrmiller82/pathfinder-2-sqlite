descr: "You manifest an aura that prevents creatures from approaching you. When casting\
  \ the spell, you can make the area any radius you choose, up to 40 feet. A creature\
  \ must attempt a Will save if it's within the area when you cast the spell or as\
  \ soon as it enters the area while the spell is in effect. Once a creature has attempted\
  \ the save, it uses the same result for that casting of repulsion. Any restrictions\
  \ on a creature's movement apply only if it voluntarily moves toward you. For example,\
  \ if you move closer to a creature, it doesn't then need to move away.  \n\n**Critical\
  \ Success**  The creature's movement is not restricted.  \n\n**Success**  The creature\
  \ treats each square in the area as difficult terrain when moving closer to you.\
  \  \n\n**Failure**  The creature can't move closer to you within the area."
