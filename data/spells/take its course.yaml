descr: "When someone has overindulged, you can hasten them past the worst of their\
  \ affliction or intensify their misery. This spell attempts to progress a disease\
  \ affliction, a poison affliction, or persistent poison damage affecting the target.\
  \ If the target is affected by more than one of these, you can choose from among\
  \ those you are aware of; otherwise the GM chooses randomly. An unwilling target\
  \ can attempt a Will save to negate take its course. The effect of this spell depends\
  \ on whether you're attempting to end an affliction or persistent poison damage,\
  \ and whether you are attempting to help or hinder the target's recovery. Affliction\
  \ The target immediately attempts its next saving throw against the affliction.\
  \ You can grant the creature your choice of a +2 status bonus or a -2 status penalty\
  \ to its saving throw against the affliction. Persistent Poison You can cause the\
  \ target take the persistent poison damage immediately when you Cast this Spell\
  \ (in addition to taking it at the end of its next turn). Whether or not you do\
  \ so, the target attempts an additional flat check against the persistent poison\
  \ damage. You can set the DC of that flat check to 5 or 20 instead of the normal\
  \ DC.  \n\n**Heightened (7th)**  You can attempt to progress any number of the target's\
  \ eligible afflictions and persistent poison damage."
