descr: "When someone has overindulged, you can hasten them past the worst of their\
  \ affliction or intensify their misery. This spell attempts to progress a disease\
  \ affliction, a poison affliction, or persistent poison damage affecting the target.\
  \ If the target is affected by more than one of these, you can choose from among\
  \ those you are aware of; otherwise the GM chooses randomly. An unwilling target\
  \ can attempt a Will save to negate *take its course*. \n\nThe effect of this spell\
  \ depends on whether you're attempting to end an affliction or persistent poison\
  \ damage, and whether you are attempting to help or hinder the target's recovery.\
  \ \n\n* **Affliction** The target immediately attempts its next saving throw against\
  \ the affliction. You can grant the creature your choice of a +2 status bonus or\
  \ a -2 status penalty to its saving throw against the affliction. \n\n* **Persistent\
  \ Poison** You can cause the target take the persistent poison damage immediately\
  \ when you Cast this Spell (in addition to taking it at the end of its next turn).\
  \ Whether or not you do so, the target attempts an additional flat check against\
  \ the persistent poison damage. You can set the DC of that flat check to 5 or 20\
  \ instead of the normal DC.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (7th)**  You can attempt to progress\
  \ any number of the target's eligible afflictions and persistent poison damage."
