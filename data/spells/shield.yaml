descr: "You raise a magical shield of force. This counts as using the Raise a Shield\
  \ action, giving you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next\
  \ turn, but it doesn't require a hand to use.\n\nWhile the spell is in effect, you\
  \ can use the Shield Block reaction with your magic shield. The shield has Hardness\
  \ 5. After you use Shield Block, the spell ends and you can't cast it again for\
  \ 10 minutes. Unlike a normal Shield Block, you can use the spell's reaction against\
  \ the *magic missile* spell. \n\nHeightening the spell increases the shield's Hardness.\
  \  \n\n---\n**Heightened (3rd)**  The shield has Hardness 10.  \n\n**Heightened\
  \ (5th)**  The shield has Hardness 15.  \n\n**Heightened (7th)**  The shield has\
  \ Hardness 20.  \n\n**Heightened (9th)**  The shield has Hardness 25."
