descr: You state a wish, making your greatest desire come true. A wish spell can produce
  any one of the following effects. Duplicate any arcane spell of 9th level or lower.
  Duplicate any non-arcane spell of 7th level or lower. Produce any effect whose power
  level is in line with the above effects. Reverse certain effects that refer to the
  wish spell. The GM might allow you to try using wish to produce greater effects
  than these, but doing so might be dangerous or the spell might have only a partial
  effect.
