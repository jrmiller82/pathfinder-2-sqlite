descr: You cause the air itself to arrest a fall. The target's fall slows to 60 feet
  per round, and the portion of the fall during the spell's duration doesn't count
  when calculating falling damage. If the target reaches the ground while the spell
  is in effect, it takes no damage from the fall. The spell ends as soon as the target
  lands.
