descr: A disk of magical force materializes adjacent to you. This disk is 2 feet in
  diameter and follows 5 feet behind you, floating just above the ground. It holds
  up to 5 Bulk of objects (though they must be able to fit and balance on its surface).
  Any objects atop the disk fall to the ground when the spell ends. The spell ends
  if a creature tries to ride atop the disk, if the disk is overloaded, if anyone
  tries to lift or force the disk higher above the ground, or if you move more than
  30 feet away from the disk.
