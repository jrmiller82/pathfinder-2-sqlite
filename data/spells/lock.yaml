descr: "The target's latch mechanism clinks shut, held fast by unseen magical restraints.\
  \ When you magically lock a target, you set an Athletics and Thievery DC to open\
  \ it equal to your spell DC or the base lock DC with a +4 status bonus, whichever\
  \ is higher. Any key or combination that once opened a lock affected by this spell\
  \ does not do so for the duration of the spell, though the key or combination does\
  \ grant a +4 circumstance bonus to checks to open the door. \n\nIf the target is\
  \ opened, the spell ends. Assuming the target is not barred or locked in some additional\
  \ way, you can unlock and open it with an Interact action during which you touch\
  \ the target. This does not end the spell. You can Dismiss this spell at any time\
  \ and from any distance.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (2nd)**  The duration increases\
  \ to unlimited, but you must expend 6 gp worth of gold dust as an additional cost."
