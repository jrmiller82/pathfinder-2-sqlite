descr: "You perform music so perfect that the target may die of joy or sorrow. Once\
  \ targeted, the creature becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute. The effect of\
  \ the spell depends on the target's level and current Hit Points.   \n\n**16th or\
  \ Lower**  The target dies instantly.   \n\n**17th**  If the target has 50 Hit Points\
  \ or fewer, it dies instantly; otherwise, it drops to 0 Hit Points and becomes dying\
  \ 1.   \n\n**18th or Higher**  The target takes 50 damage. If this brings it to\
  \ 0 Hit Points, it dies instantly."
