descr: You send the target a message of 25 words or fewer, and it can respond immediately
  with its own message of 25 words or fewer. Your message is insidious and has the
  effect of *suggestion*, with the message substituting for the spoken suggestion.
  On a successful save, the target is temporarily immune for 1 day, and on a critical
  success, the target is temporarily immune for 1 month. You can target a creature
  only if you have previously been in telepathic contact with it before, such as via
  the *telepathy* spell.
