descr: 'You utter a liberating word of power that frees a creature. You suppress one
  of the following conditions of your choice: confused, frightened, grabbed, or paralyzed.
  The target isn''t affected by the chosen condition, and if you suppress the grabbed
  condition, the target automatically breaks free from any grab affecting it when
  you Cast the Spell. If you don''t remove the effect that provided the condition,
  the condition returns after the spell ends. For example, if a spell was making the
  target confused for 1 minute, word of freedom would let the target act normally
  for a round, but the confused condition would return afterward.'
