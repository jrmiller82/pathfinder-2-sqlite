descr: "You quiet the target's voice, preventing it from giving away valuable secrets.\
  \ This doesn't prevent the target from talking or providing verbal spell components,\
  \ but no creature more than 10 feet away can hear its whispers without succeeding\
  \ at a Perception check against your spell DC, which might interfere with auditory\
  \ or linguistic effects as well as communication. The spell's duration depends on\
  \ the target's Fortitude save. After attempting its save, the target becomes temporarily\
  \ immune for 24 hours.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The target is unaffected.  \n\n\
  **Success**  The duration is 1 round.  \n\n**Failure**  The duration is 1 minute.\
  \  \n\n**Critical Failure**  The duration is 10 minutes."
