descr: You bypass your targets' rational minds, instilling them with unshakable conviction
  and zeal. The targets each gain 12 temporary Hit Points and a +2 status bonus to
  Will saves against mental effects, as their faith overrides the signals from their
  own bodies and minds. If you tell a target to do something, it must comply with
  your request, though if it would normally find the task repugnant, it can attempt
  a Will save at the end of its turn each round due to the cognitive dissonance. On
  a success, it ends the spell's effects on itself entirely.
