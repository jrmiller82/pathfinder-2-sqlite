descr: 'You bypass your targets'' rational minds, instilling them with unshakable
  conviction and zeal. The targets each gain 12 temporary Hit Points and a +2 status
  bonus to Will saves against mental effects, as their faith overrides the signals
  from their own bodies and minds. If you tell a target to do something, it must comply
  with your request, though if it would normally find the task repugnant, it can attempt
  a Will save at the end of its turn each round due to the cognitive dissonance. On
  a success, it ends the spell''s effects on itself entirely.

  **Heightened (9th)** The temporary Hit Points increase to 18, and the status bonus
