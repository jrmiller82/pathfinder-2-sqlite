descr: "You scramble a creature's mental faculties and sensory input. The target must\
  \ attempt a Will saving throw. Regardless of the result of that save, the target\
  \ is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes. *Warp mind*'s effects happen instantly,\
  \ so *dispel magic* and other effects that counteract spells can't counteract them.\
  \ However, *alter reality*, *miracle*, *primal phenomenon*, *restoration*, or *wish*\
  \ can still counteract the effects.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The target is unaffected.\
  \  \n\n**Success**  The target spends the first action on its next turn with the\
  \ confused condition.  \n\n**Failure**  The target is confused for 1 minute.  \n\
  \n**Critical Failure**  The target is confused permanently."
