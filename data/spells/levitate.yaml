action_abbr: '2'
cast: '|2| somatic, verbal'
components:
- Somatic
- Verbal
descr: You defy gravity and levitate the target 5 feet off the ground. For the duration
  of the spell, you can move the target up or down 10 feet with a single action, which
  has the concentrate trait. A creature floating in the air from *levitate* takes
  a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls. A floating creature can spend an Interact
  action to stabilize itself and negate this penalty for the remainder of its turn.
  If the target is adjacent to a fixed object or terrain of suitable stability, it
  can move across the surface by climbing (if the surface is vertical, like a wall)
  or crawling (if the surface is horizontal, such as a ceiling). The GM determines
  which surfaces can be climbed or crawled across.
