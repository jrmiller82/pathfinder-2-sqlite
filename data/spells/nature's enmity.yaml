descr: "Animals and plants in the area turn against the targets. Each target suffers\
  \ from the following effects as long as it remains in the area. \n\n* Vegetation\
  \ springs up from every surface, giving each target a -10-foot circumstance penalty\
  \ to its Speed any time it's adjacent to the plants. \n\n* Aggressive animals attack\
  \ unpredictably. At the start of its turn, each target rolls a DC 8 flat check.\
  \ On a failure, it's attacked by swarming creatures that deal 2d10 slashing damage.\
  \ The target attempts a basic Reflex save, and it is flat-footed for 1 round on\
  \ any outcome other than a critical success. \n\n* The target loses any connection\
  \ to nature or natural creatures. The target has to succeed at a DC 5 flat check\
  \ when casting any primal spell or the spell fails. Furthermore, animal or plant\
  \ creatures become hostile to it, even one with a strong bond to the target, such\
  \ as an animal companion. \n\nThe GM might decide that you can't subject some creatures,\
  \ such as an emissary of a nature deity, to the ire of nature."
