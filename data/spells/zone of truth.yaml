descr: "You designate an area in which creatures are compelled to speak only truth.\
  \ Creatures within or entering the area have difficulty lying. Each potentially\
  \ affected creature must attempt a Will save when the spell is cast or when the\
  \ creature first enters the area. It uses the results of this initial save if it\
  \ leaves and reenters the area. Affected creatures are aware of this enchantment;\
  \ therefore, they can avoid answering questions to which they would normally respond\
  \ with a lie, or they can be evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries\
  \ of the truth.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The target is unaffected.  \n\n**Success**\
  \  The target takes a -2 status penalty to Deception checks.  \n\n**Failure**  The\
  \ target can't speak any deliberate and intentional lies, and it takes a -2 status\
  \ penalty to Deception checks.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  The target can't speak\
  \ any deliberate and intentional lies and takes a -4 status penalty to Deception\
  \ checks."
