descr: "You magically spy on a creature of your choice. Scrying works like *clairvoyance*,\
  \ except that the image you receive is less precise, insuficient for teleport and\
  \ similar spells. Instead of creating an eye in a set location within 500 feet,\
  \ you instead create an eye that manifests just above the target. You can choose\
  \ a target either by name or by touching one of its possessions or a piece of its\
  \ body. If you haven't met the target in person, *scrying*'s DC is 2 lower, and\
  \ if you are unaware of the target's identity (perhaps because you found an unknown\
  \ creature's fang at a crime scene), the DC is instead 10 lower. \n\nThe effect\
  \ of *scrying* depends on the target's Will save.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The\
  \ spell fails and the target is temporarily immune for 1 week. The target also gains\
  \ a glimpse of you and learns its rough distance and direction from you.  \n\n**Success**\
  \  The spell fails and the target is temporarily immune for 1 day.  \n\n**Failure**\
  \  The spell succeeds.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  The spell succeeds, and the eye\
  \ follows the target if it moves, traveling up to 60 feet per round."
