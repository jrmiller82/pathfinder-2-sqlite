descr: "You request aid directly from your divine source. Your divine source always\
  \ refuses a request out of line with its nature, and it might grant a different\
  \ request (potentially more powerful or better fitting its nature) than the one\
  \ you asked for. A casting of miracle can do any of the following things. \n\n*\
  \ Duplicate any divine spell of 9th level or lower. \n\n* Duplicate any non-divine\
  \ spell of 7th level or lower. \n\n* Produce any effect whose power level is in\
  \ line with the above effects. \n\n* Reverse certain effects that refer to the *wish*\
  \ spell. \n\nThe GM might allow you to try using *miracle* to produce greater effects\
  \ than these, but doing so may be dangerous, or the spell may have only a partial\
  \ effect."
