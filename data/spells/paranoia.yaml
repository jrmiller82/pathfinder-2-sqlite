descr: "You cause the target to see all other creatures as dire threats. The target\
  \ is stricken by intense paranoia toward all creatures around it and must attempt\
  \ a Will save.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The target is unaffected.  \n\n**Success**\
  \  The target believes everyone it sees is a potential threat. It becomes unfriendly\
  \ to all creatures to which it wasn't already hostile, even those that were previously\
  \ allies. It treats no one as an ally. The spell ends after 1 round.  \n\n**Failure**\
  \  As success, but the effect lasts 1 minute.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  As failure,\
  \ except the target believes that everyone it sees is a mortal enemy. It uses its\
  \ reactions and free actions against everyone, regardless of whether they were previously\
  \ its allies, as determined by the GM. It otherwise acts as rationally as it normally\
  \ does and likely prefers to attack creatures that are actively attacking or hindering\
  \ it over those leaving it alone.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (6th)**  You can target\
  \ up to 5 creatures."
