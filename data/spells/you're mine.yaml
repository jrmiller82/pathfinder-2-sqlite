descr: "You manipulate the target's emotions, potentially allowing you to control\
  \ it for a brief instant. The target must attempt a Will save.  \n\n**Critical Success**\
  \  The target is unaffected.  \n\n**Success**  The target is stunned 1.  \n\n**Failure**\
  \  On the target's next turn, it's stunned 1 and you partially control it, causing\
  \ it to take a single action of your choice. If it has actions left, it can act\
  \ normally.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  The target is controlled for 1 round.  \n\
  \n**Heightened (7th)**  On a failure, the target is controlled for 1 round. On a\
  \ critical failure, the target is controlled for up to 1 minute; it receives a new\
  \ Will save at the end of each of its turns, and on a success, the spell ends."
