descr: "A weapon made of pure magical force materializes and attacks foes you designate\
  \ within range. This weapon has a ghostly appearance and manifests as your deity's\
  \ favored weapon. When you cast the spell, the weapon appears next to a foe you\
  \ choose within range and makes a Strike against it. Each time you Sustain the Spell,\
  \ you can move the weapon to a new target within range (if needed) and Strike with\
  \ it. The spiritual weapon uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty.\
  \ The weapon's Strikes are melee spell attacks. Regardless of its appearance, the\
  \ weapon deals force damage equal to 1d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.\
  \ You can deal damage of the type normally dealt by the weapon instead of force\
  \ damage (or any of the available damage types for a versatile weapon). No other\
  \ statistics or traits of the weapon apply, and even a ranged weapon attacks adjacent\
  \ creatures only. Despite making a spell attack, the spiritual weapon is a weapon\
  \ for purposes of triggers, resistances, and so forth. The weapon doesn't take up\
  \ space, grant flanking, or have any other attributes a creature would. The weapon\
  \ can't make any attack other than its Strike, and feats or spells that affect weapons\
  \ do not apply to it.  \n\n**Heightened (+2)**  The weapon's damage increases by\
  \ 1d8."
