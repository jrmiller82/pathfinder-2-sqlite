descr: "You call upon the unimaginable power of world-ending cataclysms, ripping a\
  \ small piece of each cataclysm and combining them together into one horrifically\
  \ powerful attack. The following effects come down upon all creatures in the area.\
  \ Treat the resistances of creatures in the area as if they were 10 lower for the\
  \ purpose of determining the cataclysm's damage. Each creature attempts one basic\
  \ Reflex save that applies to all six types of damage. \n\n* Flesh-dissolving acid\
  \ rain deals 3d10 acid damage. \n\n* A roaring earthquake shakes and bludgeons creatures\
  \ on the ground, dealing 3d10 bludgeoning damage. \n\n* A blast of freezing wind\
  \ deals 3d10 cold damage. * Incredible lightning lashes the area, dealing 3d10 electricity\
  \ damage. \n\n* Beating winds churn across the sky, dealing 3d10 bludgeoning damage\
  \ to creatures flying in the area. \n\n* An instant tsunami sweeps over creatures\
  \ in the area, dealing 3d10 bludgeoning damage with the water trait (doubled for\
  \ creatures swimming in the area). \n\n* A massive wildfire burns in a sudden inferno,\
  \ dealing 3d10 fire damage."
