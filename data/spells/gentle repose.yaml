descr: "The targeted corpse doesn't decay, nor can it be transformed into an undead.\
  \ If the corpse is subject to a spell that requires the corpse to have died within\
  \ a certain amount of time (for example, *raise dead*), do not count the duration\
  \ of *gentle repose* against that time. This spell also prevents ordinary bugs and\
  \ pests (such as maggots) from consuming the body.  \n\n---\n**Heightened (5th)**\
  \  The spell's duration is unlimited, but the spell takes one more action to cast\
  \ and requires a material component and a cost (embalming fluid worth 6 gp)."
duration: until the next time you make your daily preparations
