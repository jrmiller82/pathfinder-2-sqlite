descr: "Creatures in the area are outlined by glittering dust. Each creature must\
  \ attempt a Reflex save. If a creature has its invisibility negated by this spell,\
  \ it is concealed instead of invisible. This applies both if the creature was already\
  \ invisible and if it benefits from new invisibility effects before the end of the\
  \ invisibility negation effect from this spell.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The target\
  \ is unaffected.  \n\n**Success**  The target's invisibility is negated for 2 rounds.\
  \  \n\n**Failure**  The target is dazzled for 1 minute and its invisibility is negated\
  \ for 1 minute.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  The target is blinded for 1 round and\
  \ dazzled for 10 minutes. Its invisibility is negated for 10 minutes."
