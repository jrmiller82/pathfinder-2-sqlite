descr: "You make the target overconfident, leading it to ascribe failure to external\
  \ factors. If the target fails at an attack roll or skill check, it takes a -1 status\
  \ penalty to attack rolls and skill checks until the end of its turn (or the end\
  \ of its next turn, if it attempted the roll outside its turn). If the creature\
  \ fails a second time while taking this penalty, the penalty increases to -2. The\
  \ duration depends on the target's Will save. After attempting its save, the creature\
  \ becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.  \n\n**Critical Success**  The target\
  \ is unaffected.  \n\n**Success**  The duration is 1 round.  \n\n**Failure**  The\
  \ duration is 10 minutes.  \n\n**Critical Failure**  The duration is 24 hours."
