 -- "None" type traits
(1, 1, "Additive", "Feats with the additive trait allow you to spend actions to add special substances to bombs or elixirs. You can add only one additive to a single alchemical item, and attempting to add another spoils the item. You can typically use actions with the additive trait only when you’re creating an infused alchemical item, and some can be used only with the Quick Alchemy action. The additive trait is always followed by a level, such as additive 2. An additive adds its level to the level of the alchemical item you’re modifying; the result is the new level of the mixture. The mixture’s item level must be no higher than your advanced alchemy level."),
(2, 1, "Alchemical", "Alchemical items are powered by reactions of alchemical reagents. Alchemical items aren’t magical and don’t radiate a magical aura."),
(3, 1, "Apex", "When you Invest an Item that has the apex trait, it improves one of your ability scores, either increasing it by 2 or to a total of 18, whichever grants the higher score. This gives you all the benefits of the new ability score until the investiture ends. An apex item grants this benefit only the first time it’s invested within a 24-hour period, and you can benefit from only one apex item at a time. If you attempt to invest an apex item when you already have one invested, you don’t gain the ability score increase, though you do gain any other effects of Investing the Item."),
(4, 1, "Archetype", "This feat belongs to an archetype."),
(5, 1, "Artifact", "undefined"),
(6, 1, "Attack", "An ability with this trait involves an attack. For each attack you make beyond the first on your turn, you take a multiple attack penalty."),
(7, 1, "Auditory", "Auditory actions and effects rely on sound. An action with the auditory trait can be successfully performed only if the creature using the action can speak or otherwise produce the required sounds. A spell or effect with the auditory trait has its effect only if the target can hear it. This applies only to sound-based parts of the effect, as determined by the GM. This is different from a sonic effect, which still affects targets who can’t hear it (such as deaf targets) as long as the effect itself makes sound."),
(8, 1, "Aura", "An aura is an emanation that continually ebbs out from you, af ecting creatures within a certain radius. Aura can also refer to the magical signature of an item or a creature with a strong alignment."),
(9, 1, "Cantrip", "A spell you can cast at will that is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up."),
(10, 1, "Charm", "undefined"),

(12, 1, "Complex", "A hazard with this trait takes turns in an encounter."),
(13, 1, "Composition", "To cast a composition cantrip or focus spell, you usually use a type of Performance. If the spell includes a verbal component, you must use an auditory performance, and if it includes a somatic component, you must use a visual one. The spell gains all the traits of the performance you used. You can cast only one composition spell each turn, and you can have only one active at a time. If you cast a new composition spell, any ongoing effects from your previous composition spell end immediately."),
(14, 1, "Concentrate", "An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline."),
(15, 1, "Consecration", "A consecration spell enhances an area for an extended period of time. A given area can have only a single consecration effect at a time. The new effect attempts to counteract any existing one in areas of overlap."),
(16, 1, "Curse", "A curse is an effect that places some long-term affliction on a creature. Curses are always magical and are typically the result of a spell or trap."),
(17, 1, "Darkness", "Darkness effects extinguish non-magical light in the area, and can counteract less powerful magical light. You must usually target light magic with your darkness magic directly to counteract the light, but some darkness spells automatically attempt to counteract light."),
(18, 1, "Death", "An effect with the death trait kills you immediately if it reduces you to 0 HP. Some death effects can bring you closer to death or slay you outright without reducing you to 0 HP."),
(19, 1, "Dedication", "You must select a feat with this trait to apply an archetype to your character."),
(20, 1, "Detection", "Effects with this trait attempt to determine the presence or location of a person, object, or aura."),

(25, 1, "Exploration", "An activity with this trait takes more than a turn to use, and can usually be used only during exploration mode."),
(26, 1, "Extradimensional", "This effect or item creates an extradimensional space. An extradimensional effect placed inside another extradimensional space ceases to function until it is removed."),
(27, 1, "Fear", "Fear effects evoke the emotion of fear. Effects with this trait always have the mental and emotion traits as well."),
(28, 1, "Flourish", "Flourish actions are actions that require too much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn."),
(29, 1, "Focused", "An item with this trait can give you an additional Focus Point. This focus point is separate from your focus pool and doesn’t count toward the cap on your focus pool. You can gain this benefit only if you have a focus pool, and there might be restrictions on how the point can be used. You can’t gain more than 1 Focus Point per day from focused items."),
(30, 1, "Fortune", "A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally."),
(31, 1, "General", "A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat."),
(32, 1, "Haunt", "A hazard with this trait is a spiritual echo, often of someone with a tragic death. Putting a haunt to rest often involves resolving the haunt’s unfinished business. A haunt that hasn’t been properly put to rest always returns after a time."),
(33, 1, "Healing", "A healing effect restores a creature’s body, typically by restoring Hit Points, but sometimes by removing diseases or other debilitating effects."),
(34, 1, "Incapacitation", "An ability with this trait can take a character completely out of the fight or even kill them, and it’s harder to use on a more powerful character. If a spell has the incapacitation trait, any creature of more than twice the spell’s level treats the result of their check to prevent being incapacitated by the spell as one degree of success better, or the result of any check the spellcaster made to incapacitate them as one degree of success worse. If any other effect has the incapacitation trait, a creature of higher level than the item, creature, or hazard generating the effect gains the same benefits."),
(35, 1, "Incorporeal", "An incorporeal creature or object has no physical form. It can pass through solid objects, including walls. When inside an object, an incorporeal creature can’t perceive, attack, or interact with anything outside the object, and if it starts its turn in an object, it is slowed 1. Corporeal creatures can pass through an incorporeal creature, but they can’t end their movement in its space."),
(36, 1, "Infused", "You created an alchemical item with the infused trait using your infused reagents, and it has a limited time before it becomes inert. Any nonpermanent effects from your infused alchemical items, with the exception of afflictions such as slow-acting poisons, end when you make your daily preparations again."),
(37, 1, "Instinct", "Instinct abilities require a specific instinct; you lose access if you perform acts anathema to your instinct."),
(38, 1, "Light", "Light effects overcome non-magical darkness in the area, and can counteract magical darkness. You must usually target darkness magic with your light magic directly to counteract the darkness, but some light spells automatically attempt to counteract darkness."),
(39, 1, "Linguistic", "An effect with this trait depends on language comprehension. A linguistic effect that targets a creature works only if the target understands the language you are using."),
(40, 1, "Litany", "Litanies are special devotion spells, typically used by champions and requiring a single action, that usually give temporary immunity to further litanies."),
(41, 1, "Magical", "Something with the magical trait is imbued with magical energies not tied to a specific tradition of magic. A magical item radiates a magic aura infused with its dominant school of magic."),
(42, 1, "Manipulate", "You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions."),
(43, 1, "Mechanical", "A hazard with this trait is a constructed physical object."),
(44, 1, "Mental", "A mental effect can alter the target’s mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature."),
(45, 1, "Metamagic", "Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself."),
(46, 1, "Minion", "Minions are creatures that directly serve another creature. A creature with this trait can use only 2 actions per turn and can’t use reactions. Your minion acts on your turn in combat, once per turn, when you spend an action to issue it commands. For an animal companion, you Command an Animal; for a minion that’s a spell or magic item effect, like a summoned minion, you Sustain a Spell or Sustain an Activation; if not otherwise specified, you issue a verbal command, a single action with the auditory and concentrate traits. If given no commands, minions use no actions except to defend themselves or to escape obvious harm. If left unattended for long enough, typically 1 minute, mindless minions usually don’t act, animals follow their instincts, and sapient minions act how they please."),
(47, 1, "Misfortune", "A misfortune effect detrimentally alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one misfortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple misfortune effects would apply, the GM decides which is worse and applies it. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally."),
(48, 1, "Morph", "Effects that slightly alter a creature’s form have the morph trait. Any Strikes specifically granted by a morph effect are magical. You can be affected by multiple morph spells at once, but if you morph the same body part more than once, the second morph effect attempts to counteract the first (in the same manner as two polymorph effects, described in that trait)."),
(49, 1, "Move", "An action with this trait involves moving from one space to another."),
(50, 1, "Multiclass", "Archetypes with the multiclass trait represent diversifying your training into another class’s specialties. You can’t select a multiclass archetype’s dedication feat if you are a member of the class of the same name."),
(51, 1, "Oath", "Oaths add an additional tenet to your code. You can usually have only one feat with this trait."),
(52, 1, "Open", "These maneuvers work only as the first salvo on your turn. You can use an open only if you haven’t used an action with the attack or open trait yet this turn."),
(53, 1, "Plant", "Magical effects with this trait manipulate or conjure plants or plant matter in some way. Those that manipulate plants have no effect in an area with no plants."),
(54, 1, "Polymorph", "These effects transform the target into a new form. A target can’t be under the effect of more than one polymorph effect at a time. If it comes under the effect of a second polymorph effect, the second polymorph effect attempts to counteract the first. If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that target. Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect are magical. Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don’t allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry."),
(55, 1, "Possession", "Effects with this trait allow a creature to project its mind and spirit into a target. A creature immune to mental effects can’t use a possession effect. While possessing a target, a possessor’s true body is unconscious (and can’t wake up normally), unless the possession effect allows the creature to physically enter the target. Whenever the target takes damage, the possessor takes half that amount of damage as mental damage."),
(56, 1, "Precious", "Valuable materials with special properties have the precious trait. They can be substituted for base materials when you Craft items."),
(57, 1, "Prediction", "Effects with this trait determine what is likely to happen in the near future. Most predictions are divinations."),
(58, 1, "Press", "Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. An action with the press trait can be used only if you are currently affected by a multiple attack penalty. Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure don’t apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.) Because a press action requires a multiple attack penalty, you can’t use one when it’s not your turn, even if you use the Ready activity."),
(59, 1, "Rage", "You must be raging to use abilities with the rage trait, and they end automatically when you stop raging."),
(60, 1, "Reload", "While all weapons need some amount of time to get into position, many ranged weapons also need to be loaded and reloaded. This entry indicates how many Interact actions it takes to reload such weapons. This can be 0 if drawing ammunition and firing the weapon are part of the same action. If an item takes 2 or more actions to reload, the GM determines whether they must be performed together as an activity, or you can spend some of those actions during one turn and the rest during your next turn."),
(61, 1, "Revelation", "Effects with this trait see things as they truly are."),
(62, 1, "Scrying", "A scrying effect lets you see, hear, or otherwise get sensory information from a distance using a sensor or apparatus, rather than your own eyes and ears."),
(63, 1, "Secret", "The GM rolls the check for this ability in secret."),
(64, 1, "Shadow", "This magic involves shadows or the energy of the Shadow Plane."),
(65, 1, "Skill", "A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype’s dedication feat."),
(66, 1, "Sleep", "This effect can cause a creature to fall asleep or get drowsy."),
(67, 1, "Splash", "When you use a thrown weapon with the splash trait, you don’t add your Strength modifier to the damage roll. If an attack with a splash weapon fails, succeeds, or critically succeeds, all creatures within 5 feet of the target (including the target) take the listed splash damage. On a failure (but not a critical failure), the target of the attack still takes the splash damage. Add splash damage together with the initial damage against the target before applying the target’s weaknesses or resistances. You don’t multiply splash damage on a critical hit."),
(68, 1, "Stance", "A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can’t use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode."),
(69, 1, "Summoned", "A creature called by a conjuration spell or effect gains the summoned trait. A summoned creature can’t summon other creatures, create things of value, or cast spells that require a cost. It has the minion trait. If it tries to cast a spell of equal or higher level than the spell that summoned it, it overpowers the summoning magic, causing the summoned creature’s spell to fail and the summon spell to end. Otherwise, the summoned creature uses the standard abilities for a creature of its kind. It generally attacks your enemies to the best of its abilities. If you can communicate with it, you can attempt to command it, but the GM determines the degree to which it follows your commands."),
(70, 1, "Telepathy", "undefined"),
(71, 1, "Teleportation", "Teleportation effects allow you to instantaneously move from one point in space to another. Teleportation does not usually trigger reactions based on movement."),
(72, 1, "Trap", "A hazard or item with this trait is constructed to hinder interlopers."),
(73, 1, "Virulent", "Afflictions with the virulent trait are harder to remove. You must succeed at two consecutive saves to reduce a virulent affliction’s stage by 1. A critical success reduces a virulent affliction’s stage by only 1 instead of by 2."),
(74, 1, "Visual", "A visual effect can affect only creatures that can see it. This applies only to visible parts of the effect, as determined by the GM."),

-- "Alignment" type traits
(75, 2, "Chaotic", "Chaotic effects often manipulate energy from chaos-aligned Outer Planes and are anathema to lawful divine servants or divine servants of lawful deities. A creature with this trait is chaotic in alignment. An ability with this trait can be selected or used only by chaotic creatures."),
(76, 2, "Evil", "Evil effects often manipulate energy from evil-aligned Outer Planes and are antithetical to good divine servants or divine servants of good deities. A creature with this trait is evil in alignment. An ability with this trait can be selected or used only by evil creatures."),
(77, 2, "Good", "Good effects often manipulate energy from good-aligned Outer Planes and are antithetical to evil divine servants or divine servants of evil deities. A creature with this trait is good in alignment. An ability with this trait can be selected or used only by good creatures."),
