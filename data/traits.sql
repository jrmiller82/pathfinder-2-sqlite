(4,"Additive","Feats with the additive trait allow you to spend actions to add special substances to bombs or elixirs. You can add only one additive to a single alchemical item, and attempting to add another spoils the item. You can typically use actions with the additive trait only when you’re creating an infused alchemical item, and some can be used only with the Quick Alchemy action. The additive trait is always followed by a level, such as additive 2. An additive adds its level to the level of the alchemical item you’re modifying; the result is the new level of the mixture. The mixture’s item level must be no higher than your advanced alchemy level."),

This gives you all the benefits of the new ability score until the investiture ends. An apex item grants this benefit only the first time it’s invested within a 24-hour period, and you can benefit from only one apex item at a time. If you attempt to invest an apex item when you already have one invested, you don’t gain the ability score increase, though you do gain any other effects of Investing the Item."),

A spell or effect with the auditory trait has its effect only if the target can hear it. This applies only to sound-based parts of the effect, as determined by the GM. This is different from a sonic effect, which still affects targets who can’t hear it (such as deaf targets) as long as the effect itself makes sound."),

(93,"Incapacitation","An ability with this trait can take a character completely out of the fight or even kill them, and it’s harder to use on a more powerful character. If a spell has the incapacitation trait, any creature of more than twice the spell’s level treats the result of their check to prevent being incapacitated by the spell as one degree of success better, or the result of any check the spellcaster made to incapacitate them as one degree of success worse. If any other effect has the incapacitation trait, a creature of higher level than the item, creature, or hazard generating the effect gains the same benefits."),
(94,"Infused","You created an alchemical item with the infused trait using your infused reagents, and it has a limited time before it becomes inert.

Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself."),
(108,"Mindless","A mindless creature has either programmed or rudimentary mental attributes. Most, if not all, of their mental ability modifiers are –5. They are immune to all mental effects."),

For an animal companion, you Command an Animal; for a minion that’s a spell or magic item effect, like a summoned minion, you Sustain a Spell or Sustain an Activation; if not otherwise specified, you issue a verbal command, a single action with the auditory and concentrate traits. If given no commands, minions use no actions except to defend themselves or to escape obvious harm. If left unattended for long enough, typically 1 minute, mindless minions usually don’t act, animals follow their instincts, and sapient minions act how they please."),
(110,"Misfortune","A misfortune effect detrimentally alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one misfortune effect alter a single roll.

If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally."),

(112,"Monk","Abilities with this trait are from the monk class. A weapon with this trait is primarily used by monks."),
(113,"Morph","Effects that slightly alter a creature’s form have the morph trait. Any Strikes specifically granted by a morph effect are magical.

(114,"Move","An action with this trait involves moving from one space to another."),
(115,"Multiclass","Archetypes with the multiclass trait represent diversifying your training into another class’s specialties. You can’t select a multiclass archetype’s dedication feat if you are a member of the class of the same name."),
(116,"Mutagen","An elixir with the mutagen trait temporarily transmogrifies the subject’s body and alters its mind. A mutagen always conveys one or more beneficial effects paired with one or more detrimental effects. Mutagens are polymorph effects, meaning you can benefit from only one at a time."),
(117,"Necromancy","Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the necromancy school of magic, typically involving forces of life and death."),
(118,"Negative","Effects with this trait heal undead creatures with negative energy, deal negative damage to living creatures, or manipulate negative energy."),

(127,"Polymorph","These effects transform the target into a new form. A target can’t be under the effect of more than one polymorph effect at a time. If it comes under the effect of a second polymorph effect, the second polymorph effect attempts to counteract the first. If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that target. Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect are magical. Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don’t allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry."),
(128,"Positive","Effects with this trait heal living creatures with positive energy, deal positive energy damage to undead, or manipulate positive energy."),
(129,"Possession","Effects with this trait allow a creature to project its mind and spirit into a target. A creature immune to mental effects can’t use a possession effect. While possessing a target, a possessor’s true body is unconscious (and can’t wake up normally), unless the possession effect allows the creature to physically enter the target. Whenever the target takes damage, the possessor takes half that amount of damage as mental damage."),
(130,"Potion","A potion is a magical liquid activated when you drink it."),
(131,"Precious","Valuable materials with special properties have the precious trait. They can be substituted for base materials when you Craft items."),
(132,"Prediction","Effects with this trait determine what is likely to happen in the near future. Most predictions are divinations."),
(133,"Press","Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. An action with the press trait can be used only if you are currently affected by a multiple attack penalty. Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure don’t apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.) Because a press action requires a multiple attack penalty, you can’t use one when it’s not your turn, even if you use the Ready activity."),
(134,"Primal","This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical."),
(135,"Rage","You must be raging to use abilities with the rage trait, and they end automatically when you stop raging."),
(136,"Ranger","This indicates abilities from the ranger class."),
(137,"Rare","This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can’t be summoned. The DC of Recall Knowledge checks related to these creatures is increased by 5."),
(138,"Revelation","Effects with this trait see things as they truly are."),
(139,"Rogue","This indicates abilities from the rogue class."),

(143,"Shadow","This magic involves shadows or the energy of the Shadow Plane."),
(144,"Skill","A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill.

Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype’s dedication feat."),
(145,"Sleep","This effect can cause a creature to fall asleep or get drowsy."),
(146,"Snare","Traps typically made by rangers, snares follow special rules that allow them to be constructed quickly and used on the battlefield."),
(147,"Sonic","An effect with the sonic trait functions only if it makes sound, meaning it has no effect in an area of silence or in a vacuum. This is different from an auditory spell, which is effective only if the target can hear it. A sonic effect might deal sonic damage."),
(148,"Sorcerer","This indicates abilities from the sorcerer class."),
(149,"Spirit","Spirits are ephemeral creatures defined by their spiritual self and often lacking a physical form."),
(150,"Splash","When you use a thrown weapon with the splash trait, you don’t add your Strength modifier to the damage roll. If an attack with a splash weapon fails, succeeds, or critically succeeds, all creatures within 5 feet of the target (including the target) take the listed splash damage. On a failure (but not a critical failure), the target of the attack still takes the splash damage. Add splash damage together with the initial damage against the target before applying the target’s weaknesses or resistances. You don’t multiply splash damage on a critical hit."),
(151,"Staff","This magic item holds spells of a particular theme and allows a spellcaster to cast additional spells by preparing the staff."),
(152,"Stance","A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can’t use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode."),
(153,"Structure","An item with the structure trait creates a magical building or other structure when activated. The item must be activated on a plot of land free of other structures. The structure adapts to the natural terrain, adopting the structural requirements for being built there. The structure adjusts around small features such as ponds or spires of rock, but it can’t be created on water or other nonsolid surfaces. If activated on snow, sand dunes, or other soft surfaces with a solid surface underneath, the structure’s foundation (if any) reaches the solid ground. If an item with this trait is activated on a solid but unstable surface, such as a swamp or an area plagued by tremors, roll a DC 3 flat check each day; on a failure, the structure begins to sink or collapse."),
(154,"Summoned","A creature called by a conjuration spell or effect gains the summoned trait. A summoned creature can’t summon other creatures, create things of value, or cast spells that require a cost. It has the minion trait. If it tries to cast a spell of equal or higher level than the spell that summoned it, it overpowers the summoning magic, causing the summoned creature’s spell to fail and the summon spell to end. Otherwise, the summoned creature uses the standard abilities for a creature of its kind. It generally attacks your enemies to the best of its abilities. If you can communicate with it, you can attempt to command it, but the GM determines the degree to which it follows your commands."),
(155,"Talisman","A talisman is a small object affixed to armor, a shield, or a weapon (called the affixed item). You must be wielding or wearing an item to activate a talisman attached to it. Once activated, a talisman burns out permanently."),

(158,"Trap","A hazard or item with this trait is constructed to hinder interlopers."),
(159,"Uncommon","Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can’t be summoned. The DC of Recall Knowledge checks related to these creature is increased by 2."),
(160,"Undead","Once living, these creatures were infused after death with negative energy and soul-corrupting evil magic. When reduced to 0 Hit Points, an undead creature is destroyed. Undead creatures are damaged by positive energy, are healed by negative energy, and don’t benefit from healing effects."),
(161,"Unique","A rules element with this trait is one-of-a-kind. The DC of Recall Knowledge checks related to creatures with this trait is increased by 10."),
(162,"Virulent","Afflictions with the virulent trait are harder to remove. You must succeed at two consecutive saves to reduce a virulent affliction’s stage by 1. A critical success reduces a virulent affliction’s stage by only 1 instead of by 2."),
(163,"Visual","A visual effect can affect only creatures that can see it. This applies only to visible parts of the effect, as determined by the GM."),
(164,"Wand","A wand contains a single spell which you can cast once per day."),

(170,"Agile","The multiple attack penalty you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn."),
(171,"Attached","An attached weapon must be combined with another piece of gear to be used. The trait lists what type of item the weapon must be attached to. You must be wielding or wearing the item the weapon is attached to in order to attack with it. For example, shield spikes are attached to a shield, allowing you to attack with the spikes instead of a shield bash, but only if you’re wielding the shield. An attached weapon is usually bolted onto or built into the item it’s attached to, and typically an item can have only one weapon attached to it. An attached weapon can be affixed to an item with 10 minutes of work and a successful DC 10 Crafting check; this includes the time needed to remove the weapon from a previous item, if necessary.
