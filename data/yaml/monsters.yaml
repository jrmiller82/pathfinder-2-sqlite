    Unlike their leaders, who mask their actions using magical disguises, aboleths
    revel in their monstrous forms, appearing as primeval fish with tentacles. Masters
    of psychic manipulation, they are a species so ancient that they were present
    in the world when it was young, before the gods had turned their attention to
    the planet. They see all other life as something they have the right to control,
    so the idea that potential slaves might have faith in a higher power other than
    themselves enrages aboleths.

  description: 'The most numerous of the alghollthus are the ulat-kinis, a servitor
    race created from human stock to serve as rank-and-file soldiers in alghollthu
    armies. At the zenith of alghollthu power, ulat-kinis formed massive legions and
    enjoyed significant power over other species. When the alghollthus retreated from
    the world, they abandoned teeming hordes of ulatkinis. Although these erstwhile
    soldiers tried to continue their conquering ways, their numbers declined rapidly
    in battlefield defeats and purposeful exterminations enacted by their enemies.
    Ulat-kini society degenerated, so that now only a few enclaves exist in the depths
    of the earth or along isolated coastlines. Few remember their own species’ name,
    instead using the epithet their foes gave them: “skum.”'

  description: Among the subtler of the alghollthu creations were the ugothols—also
    known as faceless stalkers. These twisted beings used shapeshifting to infiltrate
    settlements and assassinate key targets. They sowed discord and replaced leaders,
    causing unwanted organizations to implode and bothersome people to lose face and
    eventually disappear. Entirely terrestrial in nature, ugothols can easily extend
    alghollthu plots above the waves for extended periods of time, giving their aquatic
    masters enhanced reach into these unpleasantly dry realms. Today, most faceless
    stalkers—like the less dangerous ulat-kinis—pursue programmed goals without the
    guidance of alghollthu rule. Faceless stalkers prefer to live as close to the
    sea coast as possible, although they are not aquatic creatures themselves. Most
    dwell in tiny tribes in marshlands. Others live in the sewers of coastal towns.

    These manipulators of mind and body alike lead their species in the open, using
    their ability to change form to walk among and deceive humans and other sapient
    species. Many veiled masters are even more powerful than the typical specimen
    presented here and can use a wide range of arcane or occult spells and rituals.
    While veiled masters command significant combat prowess and impressive magical
    skills, the greatest danger they pose to others is their uncanny ability to infiltrate
    into societies much different than their own. The most paranoid of adventurers
    and conspiracy scholars worry that every major city has been infested by secret
    cabals of vidileths, while others dismiss this as hogwash and fearmongering. The
    truth is likely somewhere in between, but it doesn’t take many veiled masters
    pulling the strings behind the scenes to wreak havoc upon an entire nation!

    this as a fundamental truth, particularly after the aeons showed the axiomites

    they continually act to improve, thus refining the concept of perfection itself.

    in gathering information on their targets or issuing challenges in a legal manner.

    description: Three times per day, a pleroma can manifest a 2-foot-diameter sphere
      of white energy that hovers above its left hand. By using a single action, which
      has the concentrate trait, the pleroma can cause the sphere to fly 10 feet.
      The sphere can move in any direction, ignoring difficult terrain, but it can’t
      move farther than 300 feet away from the pleroma. Wherever the sphere travels,
      it leaves behind a 5-foot-wide path of new matter, creating either new terrain
      (the pleroma’s choice of normal, difficult, or greater difficult terrain) or
      a 5-foot-square solid barrier of a single natural substance (such as clay, wood,
      or stone). The sphere can enter the space of a creature; when it does, the creature
      must succeed at a DC 43 Fortitude save or be absorbed into the sphere. On a
      successful save, the creature is pushed to a space of the GM’s choice away from
      the sphere. Those who fail take 20d6 positive damage (even if they are living)
      and are pushed away as a success. Those who critically fail, or are reduced
      to 0 HP by the damage from a failure, become one with the new material and can
      be restored only via a 10th-level spell. A pleroma can have only one Sphere
      of Creation in existence at a time, and the sphere automatically vanishes in
      a flash of blinding light after 1d4 minutes. All creatures within 30 feet of
      the sphere of creation when it vanishes must succeed at a DC 43 Fortitude save
      or be permanently blinded.

    description: Three times per day, a pleroma can manifest a 2-foot-diameter sphere

      and control the sphere in the same manner as its Sphere of Creation. The sphere
      is an empty void that lasts for 1 minute before collapsing in on itself and
      winking out of existence. Once manifested, the sphere can be used as a ranged
      attack, but it blinks out of existence immediately after that attack is resolved.
      Any unattended object that touches the void is sucked in and completely destroyed.
      Larger objects (such as ships or buildings) are destroyed at a rate of one 10-foot
      cube per round of contact. The sphere can enter the space of a creature, with
      effects similar to the Sphere of Creation except that it deals negative damage
      (even to undead) on a failure and annihilates rather than incorporating the
      creature into material. Such a destroyed creature can be restored only by a
      10th-level spell.

  description: Balisses, or confessor angels, seek to assist mortals ensnared by moral
    dilemmas or crises of faith. Balisses prefer to guide people to their own decisions
    rather than demand obedience to a higher cause, as intrinsic belief is even more
    powerful than blind obedience. While most balisses are fundamentally honest, they
    use their guardian angel ability to seem less intimidating and decrease the chance
    the mortal will simply acquiesce to the opinion of an obviously divine being.
    Balisses often form from souls of those who performed evil acts but were redeemed.
    Many serve the goddess Sarenrae, but they can serve other good deities and empyreal

  description: Arboreal wardens are the rangers of arboreal society. These itinerant
    folk have an innate curiosity about the woodlands in which they dwell, and rarely
    stop to take root and rest in the same part of the forest twice. This wanderlust
    makes wardens ideal forest patrollers and scouts. While they are robust combatants,
    they know better than to confront dangerous foes on their own. Instead, they report
    any dangers to arboreal regents. In rare cases, large groups of arboreal wardens
    congregate to form a copse. Copses travel beyond the boundaries of a forest to
    investigate the hinterlands and gather intelligence on potential threats before
    returning to report their findings. Arboreal wardens do not pretend to understand
    to other creatures’ motives—like most forces of the natural world, they are ambivalent
    about mortal affairs that do not involve their forest.

  description: Gancanaghs are lovers, revelers, and dashing duelists of Elysium. Embodiments

    earnest flings until their quicksilver passions change their desires. They serve
    Cayden Cailean as well as other bacchanalian deities and empyreal lords of Elysium

    love. One can give no greater insult to a gancanagh than to mistake him for such
    a creature, and more than one hotheaded gancanagh has challenged a misinformed
    paladin or other champion of good to a duel over such a slight. While they enjoy
    drinking and carousing, gancanaghs can’t stand smoke. Nonetheless, many gancanaghs
    carry whimsical-looking smoking pipes because they think it makes them look dapper.
    They cherish their silver flutes, for they enjoy the beauty of flutes’ music and
    its ability to sway the heart.

  description: Lillends are tale-tellers, chroniclers, and champions of freedom of
    expression. They are generally peaceful, but are quick to act if a masterful piece
    of art is threatened or free speech is suppressed. They pride themselves on inspiring
    mortals to greater heights of expression and creativity, and more than one bard
    looks to a lillend as their personal inspiration. Lillends sometimes secretly
    follow the adventures of mortal heroes to record their stories as epic poems and
    songs, which they then perform in the packed mead halls of Elysium. When pursuing
    such goals, lillends take pains to use their innate spells to remain in hiding,
    as they would rather observe and record events without “polluting” them with their
    own intervention. Nevertheless, a lillend who sees their charge faced with certain
    death often cannot resist the urge to intervene and save the day. Inevitably,
    this brings a close to the lillend’s chronicles, as their relationship with their
    subject invariably shifts from one of detached observation to friendship or more.
    Yet lillends remain hesitant to involve themselves for overlong in a mortal’s
    life, in part because they fear what sort of fiendish attention their presence
    might attract, but mostly out of respect for the mortal’s own destiny. A lillend
    would, all things being equal, prefer to let mortals choose their own fate rather
    than run the risk of sending someone down a path to which their heart is not set.

  description: Ghaeles are fiend-hunting knights of Elysium and champions of the freedom
    to take up arms against oppressors and other evils. Ghaeles rarely engage directly
    in mortal wars, but where fiends are involved they make an exception. A ghaele
    might assume the guise of a mortal to fight fiends alongside others, hoping to
    bolster morale and teach good tactics against such supernatural foes. Ghaeles
    serve various deities and empyreal lords of Elysium, though many have an affinity
    for Cayden Cailean in his capacity as a champion of freedom and defender of the
    downtrodden. Among azatas, ghaeles are generally the quickest to shift to violence
    as a method of solving problems, but even then they seek to minimize pain and
    suffering when they can.

    arise from elves who were slain by trusted friends and allies, or whose loved
    ones betrayed them on their deathbeds. Others spawn from elves whose treacherous
    deeds shortly before their deaths left a stain upon their souls. Regardless of
    their origin, banshees despise the living. This hatred of life is all too often
    a horrific inversion of their personalities in life. Some speculate that the more
    kind-hearted the elf (and the more wrenching the betrayal), the crueler the banshee.

  description: Few sea monsters are as dreaded and feared as the two-headed baomal.
    These massive predatory beasts typically dwell in the deepest waters and compete

    baomals that encounter ships quickly learn that they contain a variety of tasty
    morsels. The creatures use their devastating spikes to rip open the ships’ hulls,

    have no innate ability to travel the planes, though, the time it takes for most

    if not decades. During that time, greater barghests continue to play the roles
    of gluttons, hunters of humanity, and tyrants of goblinoid tribes. More than a

    end goal of returning to the Abyss, despite the fact that those who do make such
    a return home often grow even more powerful over time, gaining eerie new abilities

    pose a significant threat to larger prey alone (and indeed, these blood-drinkers
    can feed without their sleeping victims ever noticing), some unusually aggressive
    species of these bats hunt in deadly swarms. A churning cloud of vampire bats
    is much more dangerous than the sum of its individual parts and is capable of
    inflicting an overwhelming number of bleeding wounds in a frighteningly short

  description: While big bats are certainly not uncommon in dark caves and abandoned
    ruins and may instill fear in squeamish spelunkers, the so-called giant bat is
    a true monster, weighing well over 100 pounds and having a wingspan of nearly
    15 feet. It primarily eats fruit and bugs, but can be incited to violence through
    fear or hunger. Giant bat attacks can quickly give rise to rumors of more dangerous
    monsters—many mistake these massive animals for some sort of demon or vampiric
    monster. But like other bats, giant bats are simply social and intelligent mammals.
    They are sometimes used as mounts by smaller humanoids, commonly those who hail
    from or dwell in mountainous or underground regions.

    bears are especially temperamental when their young are nearby. In combat, a grizzly
    bear often attempts to grab and maul its foe with surprising ferocity. It continues
    its assault until its foe seems like it is no longer a threat, though if the bear
    is hungry, it will not hesitate to feed.

  description: Larger, stronger, and far more aggressive than its smaller cousins,
    the cave bear is a behemoth that avoids civilized lands, preferring to dwell in
    remote places. As its name might suggest, the cave bear makes its den in natural
    caves, and like the grizzly bear, a cave bear is fiercely territorial. Unlike
    a grizzly bear, however, a cave bear is short tempered and will make sure its
    foe is dead before moving on, usually feasting on its prey’s soft flesh once it
    has been incapacitated. Cave bears are often regarded as powerful guardian spirits
    by remote-dwelling people, while they are utilized as beasts of war by orcs or
    even giants—stone giants in particular have an affinity for keeping trained cave
    bears as pets or guardians for their homes.

  description: Scourges of swamps and damp, abandoned places, bloodseekers are ravenous
    blood drinkers. Farmers curse the creatures for sucking their livestock dry. It
    is from such beleaguered people that the bloodseeker’s regional name “stirge,”
    possibly a corruption of the word “scourge,” comes. Folk wisdom holds that the
    appearance of bloodseekers in a region signals a healthy herd of livestock, but
    more often it means bogs or old buildings that haven’t been properly tended to.
    Certainly, no amount of folksy parable can assuage a farmer driven to destitution
    by a bloodseeker infestation. But despite their role as parasites, bloodseekers
    aren’t hated by all villages. In some cases, the inhabitants of remote backwoods
    thorps even keep the things as pets or use them as doubtful medicinal “tools”
    to drain away unwanted humors or test for evil spirits possessing the blood. Worshippers
    of gods of pestilence and parasites often view bloodseekers as sacred to their
    faith and allow the creatures to feed freely from their bodies. In such societies,
    those who accidentally give too much are considered to have been “blessed” by
    the village’s hungry god.

  description: The azure worm is a deep-blue creature that is more at home in flooded
    tunnels than dry caves. While an azure worm is a strong swimmer, it prefers to
    lie in wait within the walls, door, or even ceiling of flooded caverns, ready
    to spring out and ambush creatures swimming past its hiding spot. The azure worm
    is particularly hated and feared by Darklands-dwelling cultures, due to the fact
    that an azure worm that burrows into a tunnel often brings with it waters from
    the submerged river or lake it calls home. When it becomes obvious that an azure
    worm is near a Darklands settlement, the inhabitants quickly establishing a hunting
    party to deal with the menace before it can bring ruin.

  description: Among the most dangerous cave worms are the fiery crimson worms. In
    addition to being even larger than azure or purple worms, the crimson worm has
    a penchant for burrowing through volcanic regions that, over the generations,
    have infused it with a supernatural link to the Elemental Plane of Fire. The molten
    heart of an active volcano is an attractive lair for a crimson worm, as are the
    sprawling fields of bubbling magma found in the deepest reaches of the Darklands.
    Legends from ancient peoples, precursor dwarven societies, and colonists of the
    Elemental Planes populated moats of lava with crimson worms likely have some basis
    in truth, although the methods such ancients used to keep these “moat worms” contained
    and prevented them from chewing their way through fortress foundations must have
    been significant.

  description: Centaurs are legendary hunters and trackers who resemble heavily muscled
    humans with the bodies of powerful horses from the waist down. They are typically
    reclusive but haughty, quick to assume that their handsome physiques and long
    history of cultural traditions make them superior to any two-legged folk they
    encounter. While stories of bloody clashes between centaurs and humanoid settlers
    are well known, centaurs are neither intrinsically bloodthirsty nor recklessly
    aggressive. Rather, they are proud and stubborn and do not take kindly to outsiders
    who encroach on their ancestral grounds, some of which have been ruled by centaurs
    for thousands of years. Against despoilers of nature who fail to heed their warnings,
    centaurs do not hesitate to use their finely honed hunting skills to inflict deadly
    wounds.

    nest in small groups but hunt alone when they seek out food. Attempts to domesticate

      The target must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or become slowed 1 (or slowed
      2 on a critical failure). Further failed saves against calcification increase
      the slowed condition. Once a creature’s actions are reduced to 0 by calcification,
      that creature becomes petrified. Every 24 hours after it was petrified, the
      victim can attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save to recover. On a success, it becomes
      flesh again, but is slowed 1 for the next 24 hours. On a critical success, the
      creature recovers and isn’t slowed. On a failure, the creature remains petrified,
      but can try again in 24 hours. On a critical failure, the petrification is permanent,
      and the creature can’t attempt any more saves.

  description: Crocodiles can be found basking on riverbanks, lurking in swamps, or
    floating in lakes. They are usually are indistinguishable from logs when viewed
    from afar—at least until they attack. Alligators have similar statistics, but
    because they often live in more temperate climates, they endure cold temperatures
    better. Unlike alligators, crocodiles can tolerate salt water. Both are formidable
    predators that are likely to devour careless adventurers who fail to watch where
    they step.

  description: These unnerving, almost reptilian daemons represent death by direct
    assault against a soul or life-force—the same numbing death they bring with their
    fell touch. Rarely seen on the Material Plane, astradaemons spend most of their
    time hunting the pathways between the living world and the afterlife. There, they
    capture migrating souls, snatching them from their rightful rewards or punishments
    and dragging them to Abaddon as tribute to their undying masters. These horrifying
    predators of the dead can also be found stalking the banks of the River of Souls
    in the Astral Plane, where they constantly hunt for new victims. Psychopomps have
    a particular hatred of astradaemons as a result, and clashes between them and
    these eerie hunters of the recently departed are indeed the stuff of legend.

  description: Glabrezus are looming behemoths who revel in the act of twisting mortal
    desires into their ultimate ruin, betraying and manipulating as easily as they
    breathe. Desires granted by a glabrezu always come to fruition in the most destructive
    way possible, turning a wish or hope into a potent and devastating act of betrayal—although
    the long-term repercussions are not always immediately apparent. For example,
    a struggling weapon smith might wish for fame and skill at their craft, only to
    find that their best patron is a cruel and sadistic murderer who uses the weapons
    in bloody sprees. Or a lonely widower might have his desire granted in the form
    of a lost love returned to “life” as a vampire. Glabrezus are nothing if not creative
    in addressing a mortal’s needs.

  description: When folk whisper frightened tales of the demonic, what most envision
    is the balor—a towering figure of fire and flesh, a horned nightmare armed with
    a flaming whip and a sword flying through the night in search of its latest victim.
    On the Abyss, balors serve demon lords as generals or captains, and they typically
    command vast legions of demons. Standing at 14 feet in height, only the cruelest
    mortal souls—those who devoted entire lives to sins too numerous to count—can
    fuel the formation of a balor. More often, a balor forms from a mass of dozens
    of mortal souls who shared debased ideologies in life. <h3 class="title">Balor
    Lords</h3> Those rare few balors who form from single souls are the ones most
    likely to eventually transcend the notable power they already wield, becoming
    a nascent demon lord. These balor lords are each unique creatures of 21st to 25th
    level in power who rule their own realm in the Abyss. In time, a balor lord can
    further develop into a unique creature with wildly different powers, even ascending
    to the role of a true demon lord.

    and transforming it into a more powerful devil (see the pit fiend’s Devil Shaping

  description: Imps are infiltrators and corruptors who, despite their diminutive
    stature, are more than capable of subtly influencing a weak-willed individual
    into performing increasingly evil acts over time. An imp will often agree to serve
    a mortal and act docile and loyal in a long-term plot to eventually damn its master’s
    soul to Hell. Imps are born directly from Hell itself, rather than from mortal
    souls, and thus they serve outside the usual diabolic hierarchy, granting them
    leeway to pursue their specialties. Despite standing a mere 2-feet tall, imps
    can be vicious combatants, flying out of reach and turning invisible to escape
    should the odds turn against them.

  description: Barbazus, known also as bearded devils or infantry devils, are murderous
    fiends who satiate their lust for annihilation by serving as the foot soldiers
    of Hell’s armies, often leading hordes of lesser devils such as imps and lemures
    into battle. Bearded devils wield serrated glaives to inflict jagged gashes that
    resist healing magic, resulting in tremendous blood loss. When enemies come too
    close, bearded devils strike with the spines of their wriggling beards to deliver
    a wretched contagion called Avernal fever, savoring the sight of their victim’s
    strength being slowly devoured from within.

  description: Contract devils are clerks, scribes, and bureaucrats of Hell rarely
    found outside the infernal courts, and then almost always to pursue potential
    contracts, tempting mortals to sell their souls in exchange for achieving their
    worldly desires. If a target is desirable enough, a phistophilus can offer contracts
    for prices seemingly lesser than their soul all at once, though in this case,
    the devil carefully manipulates the price to drive the signatory toward the forces
    of law and evil, and therefore ultimately to Hell anyway. Contract devils are
    tall creatures with skin tones that range from bronze to crimson and large curving
    horns extending from their bodies, over which they often drape favored or important
    contracts.

  description: Insectile ice devils are strategists and masterminds in Hell’s armies,
    using their superior intellect to strike against their enemies and spread Hell’s
    influence throughout the planes. An ice devil rarely breaks their solitary contemplation
    of strategy save to pursue a plan they have devised. They can be enticed otherwise
    only by an exchange of services to be determined at a later time, adding to the
    pieces they can play on the board. Occasionally, a mortal strategist of outstanding
    skill might amuse an ice devil enough for the gelugon to agree to a contest of
    strategy, typically a strategic board game like chess, to decide a dispute. In
    the unlikely event the devil loses such a contest, they inevitably go to great
    lengths to later obtain that mortal’s services for their own infernal ends.

  description: When an army of devils invades to bathe a region in bloodshed and hellfire,
    it is likely that one of Hell’s most powerful and diabolical generals, the pit
    fiend, masterminded the incursion. Cunning, powerful, and ruthless, pit fiends
    often serve the archdevils directly. They rule infernal duchies, subjugate mortal
    worlds, and usurp infernal rivals using unparalleled despotism and calculated
    ferocity. To realize their tyrannical machinations, pit fiends claim mortal souls
    that they corrupt into lemure servants, which can then be shaped and transformed
    through infernal manipulation into the terrifying devils that form Hell’s formidable
    legions. They often select the most wicked and vicious lemures for their armies,
    drawing upon these lesser devils’ depravity during powerful magical ceremonies
    to create hideous and terrifying abominations that can cow and eviscerate the
    pit fiend’s enemies.

  - description: The pit fiend reshapes a large number of lemures within a 600-foot
      radius into more powerful devils to swell Hell’s legions. The pit fiend must
      have available the number of lemures listed on the table in the sidebar. The
      pit fiend can shape 100 lemures per day, to a maximum of 1,100 lemures in 11
      days. Devils created in this way are in thrall to the pit fiend and follow its
      orders, with the exception of created pit fiends or other devils of similar
      power, which are always independent. As a result, few pit fiends choose to create
      peers. At the end of the Devil Shaping activity, the pit fiend attempts an incredibly
      hard Religion check of the desired devil’s level, with results as follows. **Critical
      Success** The pit fiend shapes two devils from the massed lemures instead of
      one. **Success** The pit fiend shapes a devil of the desired type and level.
      **Failure** The devil shaped from the lemures is 2 levels lower than the intended
      devil. **Critical Failure** The pit fiend fails to shape any devils and draws
      the ire of an archdevil for its waste of resources.

  description: Dezullons are dangerous carnivorous pitcher plants that dwell in forested
    regions with thick canopies. They hunt for meat along the forest’s understory
    when not sunning themselves in the boughs above. Dezullons are smart enough to
    notice that some creatures are attracted by shiny things, and sometimes use such
    objects to set up ambushes. To assume that the dezullon’s ambulations are slow
    simply because the creature has a root structure is a foolish mistake; many an
    adventurer has been crushed to death by this surprisingly agile plant. In addition,
    these dangerous plants are expert climbers, making their pursuit even more difficult
    to escape from.

  description: A smaller cousin of the deinonychus, the velociraptor is a swift, cunning
    pack hunter. It has no fear of larger creatures, and a group of these dinosaurs
    won’t hesitate to attack creatures the size of a horse. Velociraptors are social
    animals, and tend to live in groups of up to a dozen other velociraptors. They
    have manes of feathery plumage that extend down their backs and along the sides
    of their arms, legs, and tail, while their underbellies and flanks are scaly.
    These feathers allow them to blend into their natural terrains with ease, but
    when excited, attempting to intimidate, or seeking a mate, a velociraptor can
    puff and frill this plumage to expose much brighter colors normally covered by
    the longer feathers. A typical velociraptor is 1-1/2 feet tall, 7 feet long, and
    weighs 35 pounds.

  description: Triceratopses are muscular quadrupeds with powerful but short legs,
    thick necks, and heads crowned by a wide, bony frill. Though they bear a large
    horn on their snout and one on each brow, these dinosaurs are herbivores and use
    these bony protrusions only to defend themselves from attackers or in dramatic
    clashes against other triceratopses for grazing territory or mates. Short-tempered
    and obstinate, triceratopses are unlikely to back down from a fight unless they
    are hopelessly outmatched, and the creatures are known to fight to the death for
    no apparent reason beyond stubbornness. Triceratopses often serve as mounts for
    lizardfolk, orcs, and giants, who ride comfortably behind the dinosaurs’ protective
    bone frills. A triceratops is 30 feet long and weighs as much as 10 tons.

    stout bodies and long, sinuous necks ending in small heads, allowing them to graze
    from the highest treetops. Their powerful tails are equally as long as their necks
    and provide counterbalances. Brontosauruses bear their bulk upon four stout legs.
    Although their feet are capable of crushing entire buildings, these herbivores
    are generally peaceful and considerate of where they step.

  description: The typical guard dog is loyal to and beloved by many communities.
    Often adored as pets, they also excel as protectors and trackers, and can be fearless
    when defending a beloved master or family member. The statistics presented below
    work well for any number of breeds of dog ranging from 20 to 50 pounds in weight.
    Wild dogs can also use these statistics, but their untamed nature makes them far
    more unpredictable and threatening. Feral dogs are perhaps even more dangerous,
    for unlike their wild cousins, feral dogs often lack the instinctual fear of humanity
    that stops wild creatures from interacting with people.

    dragons. Their brand of evil is organized, manipulative, and regal. Blue dragons
    often lair near or within cities and set out to bend the population to their will
    and gather hordes of servants. These dragons love spinning webs of conspiracy.
    A blue dragon’s lackeys typically don’t even realize that they serve a dragon,
    but instead think the protection money, tariffs, or taxes they are amassing is
    treasure for a cruel but legitimate master. In some ways, blue dragons even see
    their servants as a living hoard and value them like treasure. These dragons have
    been known to use these tactics even with their own chromatic cousins.

  description: Brass dragons are whimsical tricksters who delight in humor and play.
    They particularly enjoy conversations with humans and other civilized humanoids,
    delighting in the naive customs of these diminutive races without showing them
    haughtiness or scorn. While they may seem merely curious, brass dragons engage
    in this sort of conversation with the goal of keeping up to date on regional politics
    so they can anticipate future conflicts. Along the way, they create extensive
    information networks that begin with their own allies but stretch across all levels
    of humanoid society—networks which the brass dragon then uses to subtly assist
    settlements near their lair. Unlike the schemes and manipulations of blue dragons,
    brass dragons use their informant networks to establish justice and equality.

  description: Capricious and always eager to share a good laugh, copper dragons are

  description: Gold dragons are the epitome of metallic dragonkind, unrivaled in their

    Golds rival the raw power of even red dragons, much to the chagrin of their chromatic

    might find this behavior strange, considering the longstanding war between chromatic
    and metallic dragons, but dragons know all too well that desperate situations
    sometimes call for drastic alliances. And although gold dragons might consider
    brief truces with their chromatic brethren in the case of world-ending threats,

    are, they necessarily take a wide view of all situations and never act without
    considering all possible options and outcomes. Because of this, gold dragons willingly
    converse with any creature that seeks them out, even evil chromatic dragons. Mortals
    might find this behavior strange, considering the longstanding war between chromatic
    and metallic dragons, but dragons know all too well that desperate situations
    sometimes call for drastic alliances. And although gold dragons might consider
    brief truces with their chromatic brethren in the case of world-ending threats,
    they also know when such alliances have run their course.

  description: When sailors warn others of the terrible threats of the open sea, they
    seldom forget to mention dragon turtles—immense aquatic dragons with rocky shells
    similar to those of tortoises and flippers powerful enough to overturn hardy vessels.
    These fearsome creatures enjoy being considered as dangerous as storms or natural
    disasters by seafaring folk. Dragon turtles delight in amassing treasure, although
    most prefer to receive tribute from passing sailors and often store their hoards
    in the shipwrecks of vessels once crewed by those unwilling to surrender their
    valuables. Dragon turtles are solitary creatures and hunt in regions encompassing
    a hundred square miles or more. Although they normally eat large fish, they are
    omnivorous and also eat seaweed or even foolhardy dragon hunters. Experienced
    sailors keep a keen eye out for dragon turtles, preparing to flee should one approach
    or offer it treasure in exchange for safe passage.

    drakauthix’s digestive process is entirely external—it clings to victims, and
    its spore-laden surface slowly feeds on and grows through the flesh before the
    spore-infested carcass is discarded. As the infested body strikes the ground below,
    it bursts and releases a cloud of spores, unleashing a host of young called sporelings
    that immediately scuttle up the cavern walls to cling to its ceiling and grow.

  description: The distant kin of red dragons, flame drakes thankfully lack the intelligence
    and ambition of their larger cousins, but are no less territorial or violent.
    Flame drakes dwell near volcanoes and magma, but it’s not unheard of for one to
    drift into nearby areas like forests or wooded hills. Their scales are usually
    some shade of red, occasionally fading to smoky blacks and grays along the edges
    of their wings and the tips of their tails.

  description: Believed to be related to green dragons, jungle drakes are dangerous
    hunters equipped with a debilitating venom delivered by a large barbed stinger

    Jungle drakes prefer to ambush their prey using hit-and-run tactics, picking off
    the weakest members of a group and dragging their victims off to finish their

  description: A wyvern is a venomous drake with a well-earned reputation for impatience
    and aggression. As much as 15 feet long and weighing up to 1,000 pounds, a wyvern’s
    resilient body allows it to crash talons-first into large prey without serious
    risk to itself. A wyvern uses its momentum to stun its target before injecting
    it with searing venom or carrying it over the side of a nearby cliff. Because
    a wyvern lacks the strength to haul its prey all the way to its nest intact, it
    is far more likely to lift and drop its victim over a gully or canyon and let
    gravity do its work before it descends to pick apart the carcass.

  description: Frost drakes pose an immense danger in the frozen reaches they call
    home, where they roam far and wide to hunt for prey such as caribou, wolves, small
    bears, and tundra-dwelling people. Related as they are to white dragons, these
    drakes share many habits and facets of their disposition with their draconic cousins.
    Indeed, just as white dragons are among the most bestial and craven of dragonkind,
    frost drakes are among the most depraved and openly malicious of the drakes. They
    are also especially insolent, and are less likely to back down from a flight compared
    to other drakes. Many frost drakes have met their ends trying to enact cruelties
    beyond their means, such as singly taking on an entire castle or well-fortified
    township. Although a frost drake can wreak much destruction on its own, tales
    of village-dwelling northerners banding together to defend their homes from these
    rogue menaces are fairly common.

  description: Water mephits are consummate jokers who are always happy to trade a
    favor for a good laugh. Just as fire mephits are the ones who cleave closest to
    evil without fully crossing over into true villainy, water mephits are the friendliest
    of the mephits and therefore the closest to good. Still, one should take care
    in making assumptions about a water mephit’s benevolence, for no one can reliably
    count on them to keep their inborn need for pranks and trickery at bay for long.
    Water mephits have blue-green skin that shimmers in light like   sh scales. Though
    water mephits’ wings look more like webbed fins than limbs capable of flight,
    they can flap their wings to fly through the air as easily as any other mephit.
    Water mephits prefer to swim, when possible, and they leave the water only when
    they must.

  description: Those who live near elephants have learned to be wary of angering the
    beasts, but even with precautions in place, elephants sometimes still rampage.
    There is little an individual person can do when even a single elephant becomes
    enraged. Furthermore, a herd of angry or frightened elephants can easily destroy
    an entire village.

  description: Ether spiders are deadly predators from the Ethereal Plane resembling
    giant arachnids. Rather than building webs of silk, ether spiders shape the raw
    essence of the Ethereal Plane, weaving it in complex patterns that drift through
    the misty void. From these ethereal nests, whole families of ether spiders can
    scout the adjacent Material Plane, watching for easy prey in dark or remote corners
    of the land of mortals. Once an ether spider has spotted a meal, it anchors its
    nest and waits on the Ethereal Plane for its prey to draw near. As soon as its
    victim is within reach, the ether spider shifts to the Material Plane, clamps
    its fangs onto its prey, then shifts back to the Ethereal Plane to wait as its
    venom works through the creature’s system. Ether spiders move between the planes
    with ease, making them extremely dangerous to those who cannot see or attack ethereal
    enemies.

  description: 'The first fleshwarping process mastered by the drow remains both their
    most successful and most infamous: the drider. Fusing the body of a drow with
    that of a giant spider, driders are a sexually dimorphic fleshwarp—the only fleshwarp
    known to be able to produce young. While female driders have the upper torsos
    of elegant drow women with mouths featuring sharp poisoned fangs, male driders
    have hideous, mutated countenances that further blend the humanoid form with that
    of a spider; the difference in appearance is perhaps a reflection on the matriarchal
    nature of drow society. In combat, all driders are equally dangerous.'

  description: Gargoyles are monstrous hunters made of elemental stone. They use their
    resemblance to decorative statues to hide in plain sight in cities during the

    of a horned humanoid with bat-like wings, but individual gargoyles show a great
    deal of variation, with some appearing more or less humanoid and others resembling
    no known creature. A gargoyle’s features are not flxed; city-dwelling gargoyles
    who remain in the same locale long enough slowly morph, day by day, to match the
    style of the local architecture. These patient monsters can stay disguised for
    long stretches of time as they patiently await an opportunity to strike.

  description: Benevolent genies from the Plane of Air, djinn value art, culture,
    knowledge, and trade. They also love new experiences, succulent dishes, and heady
    wines. Of all geniekind, they are most likely to approach humans and other mortals,
    interacting with them on friendly terms. Still, djinn are proud of their genie
    heritage and have a tendency to be patronizing toward mortals, a habit that has
    earned them a reputation for arrogance. Djinn get along with jann and marids,
    but they find shaitans too stiff and harbor undying hatred for efreet. Although
    djinn are formidable combatants, they despise war and prefer to eschew violence
    in favor of dealing with their opponents using magic or subterfuge (making an
    exception, of course, when they encounter efreet).

  description: Frost giants are remorseless marauders who pillage and plunder from
    those who dare to live near them in desolate, frigid lands. Their clans range
    from extremely territorial hunters who claim an expanse of tundra and defend it
    at all costs to nomadic hordes that roam icy slopes in search of settlements to
    conquer. Frost giant clans are ruled by those who exhibit the greatest ferocity
    and prowess in battle—massive brutes who proclaim themselves jarl and demand absolute
    obedience from their followers. If at any time a frost giant wishes to be a jarl,
    all they must do is issue a challenge to the current jarl and face off in mortal
    combat, after which the reigning champion continues leading the clan or the victorious
    challenger assumes control.

  description: The most militaristic of all giants, fire giants focus obsessively
    on learning combat techniques, mastering the arts of forging weapons and armor,
    and finding new ways to dominate their enemies. As a result, their social and
    political structures are grounded firmly in martial hierarchies, with a strict
    emphasis on following the orders of one’s superior, no matter if you are accountable
    to a lowly soldier or report to a powerful officer. As soon as a fire giant can
    walk, they are fitted with their first suit of forged armor. This armor is constantly
    remolded and replaced as the fire giant matures, both to ensure they are comfortable
    with steel against their skin and also to teach the giant as early as possible
    that they bear the burden of fighting to protect their traditions and way of life.
    To a fire giant, death is the flame in which the future is forged.

  description: The graceful and regal cloud giants have skin of milky white to powdery
    blue. Unlike most giants, cloud giants are quite morally diverse. A handful are
    neutral, but of the others, roughly half are good, while the other half are evil.
    Good cloud giants are often civic-minded builders of roads and settlements, and
    are interested in trading goods as well as cultural innovations. It’s not uncommon
    for such giants to approach their neighbors with diplomacy and build strong relationships
    with other peaceful peoples. Conversely, evil cloud giants are often isolationist
    and xenophobic. Preferring hidden mountain valleys and settlements in the caves
    and among the crags of lonely peaks, they raid for what they want and treat other
    creatures like inconsequential insects. These opposing philosophies can generate
    a great deal of strife among neighboring cloud giant communities, and the raiders
    often threaten the trade deals of their peaceful cousins.

    In this way, they embody both the fury of a raging tempest and the calm of a hurricane’s
    eye. This can make them valuable allies who race to the aid of those in need,
    but their allies remain must be alert and mindful of their mood, as the giants
    can be quick to anger or aggressive when caution is most appropriate.

  description: Magically crafted and bred by ancient wizards, rune giants are anathema
    to and tyrants among their own kind, who were given power to command and magically
    control other giants. The rune giants themselves served even more powerful masters—potent
    wizards known as runelords—and in so doing commanded entire armies of giants on
    behalf of the runelords’ empires. In the eons since these empires collapsed, rune
    giants have persisted as a people of their own, though to the outside world they’re
    little more than fabled horrors whispered of late at night by superstitious giants.
    Rune giants usually dwell in the most remote and rugged of towering mountain ranges,
    but they can also be found in immense ruins atop lost islands, glacial valleys,
    or even more remote or magical regions.

  description: Some goblins take their people’s admiration of fire fully into the
    realm of deadly obsession. These pyromaniacs can be a great boon to a band of
    goblin raiders eager to torch their enemies and wreak havoc. More often, however,
    their presence is a double-edged sword; in the heat of the moment, goblin pyros
    sometimes lose sight of their tribe’s goals and simply set fire to anything that
    will burn—including their own allies.

  description: Made of odd scraps of skin and muscle, a flesh golem is a grotesque
    parody of life. Though it has no mind, it can still go into a berserk rage when
    harmed, giving it a faint semblance of emotion. Flesh golems guard the laboratories
    and charnel houses of fleshwarpers and necromancers who feel no compunctions about
    desecrating corpses for their own ends. Though the first flesh golem is believed
    to have been a misguided attempt to create from simple base elements, these monstrosities
    are far from human. In isolated cases, echoes of a personality might rise in a
    flesh golem if the brain used as part of its construction belonged to a particularly
    powerful personality, but such tragic instances are (thankfully) rare in the extreme.

  description: 'Graveknights are undead warriors granted unlife by a cursed suit of
    armor. <h2 class="title">Creating Graveknights</h2> You can turn an existing,
    living creature into a graveknight by completing the following steps. It’s best
    to build a graveknight from scratch, but if you don’t have the time, simply apply
    the template. A creature should be at least level 5 before being converted to
    a graveknight. Increase the creature’s level by 1 and change its statistics as
    follows. <ul><li>Increase its attack rolls, AC, saving throws, Perception, and
    skills by 1, its HP by 5, and its Strike damage by 1.</li></ul> <h3 class="title">Graveknight
    Abilities</h3> A graveknight gains the undead and graveknight traits, and its
    alignment is usually adjusted to evil. It loses any abilities that come from it
    being a living creature and any traits that represent its life, such as human
    and humanoid. **Darkvision** **Negative Healing** **Rejuvenation** (divine, necromancy)
    When a graveknight is destroyed, its armor rebuilds its body over the course of
    1d10 days—or more quickly if the armor is worn by a living host (see Graveknight
    Armor, below). If the body is destroyed before then, the process restarts. A graveknight
    can only be permanently destroyed by obliterating its armor (such as with disintegrate),
    transporting it to the Positive Energy Plane, or throwing it into the heart of
    a volcano. **Immunities** death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, precision,
    unconscious, plus one energy type (the same chosen for ruinous weapons below).
    **Sacrilegious Aura** (abjuration, aura, divine, evil) 30 feet. When a creature
    in the aura uses a positive spell or ability, the graveknight automatically attempts
    to counteract it, with the listed counteract modifier. **Devastating Blast** |2|
    (arcane, evocation) The graveknight unleashes a 30-foot cone of energy. Creatures
    in the area take 1d12 damage, plus an additional 1d12 damage for every two levels
    the graveknight has (basic Reflex save). The graveknight can use this ability
    once every 1d4 rounds. This energy damage is of the same type as that of its ruinous
    weapons (see below); Devastating Blast gains the associated energy trait. **Phantom
    Mount** |2| (arcane, conjuration, summon) The graveknight summons a supernatural
    mount as per phantom steed, heightened to a level equal to half the graveknight’s
    level. Unlike phantom steed, the steed’s AC and saving throw bonuses are all 4
    lower than the graveknight’s, and the steed has one-third the graveknight’s Hit
    Points (rounded down). If the steed is destroyed, the graveknight must wait 1
    hour before using this ability again. **Ruinous Weapons** At the time of its creation,
    a graveknight chooses one of the following energy types that was relevant to its
    life or death: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Any weapon the graveknight wields
    gains the effects of the caustic, frost, shock, or flaming weapon rune, respectively,
    in addition to a +1 striking weapon rune. If the graveknight is 14th level or
    higher, its weapons instead gain the effects of the greater versions of both of
    these runes. **Weapon Master** The graveknight has access to the critical specialization
    effects of any weapons it wields. <h3 class="title">Alternate Graveknight Abilities</h3>
    Although the abilities listed above are standard for a graveknight, you can create
    a more unusual graveknight by substituting one of the aforementioned abilities
    (except for its rejuvenation ability) with one of the following. **Betrayed Revivification**
    The graveknight died after being deeply betrayed. Instead of being immune to a
    type of energy damage, it is immune to mental damage, its weapons deal 1d6 additional
    mental damage, and its Devastating Blast deals mental damage with a Will saving
    throw instead of Reflex. **Create Grave Squire** The graveknight can gift a piece
    of its armor to a willing ally, which becomes its grave squire. The graveknight
    can communicate telepathically with its squire at any distance, see through the
    squire’s senses, and cast suggestion as a divine innate spell through the telepathic
    link at will; the squire treats its degree of success as one step worse. If the
    graveknight’s main armor is destroyed, the squire’s piece expands to cover the
    squire’s body over 1d10 days, after which point it becomes the graveknight’s new
    body. The graveknight can have only one squire at a time, and must recover the
    gifted piece of armor if it wishes to create a new squire. **Dark Deliverance**
    The graveknight has positive resistance equal to its level. <h2 class="title">Graveknight
    Armor</h2> Wearing graveknight armor is very risky, for the graveknight’s essence
    rapidly parasitizes the new wearer, accelerating the graveknight’s rejuvenation.
    This agonizing transformation inevitably kills the host, transforming their flesh
    into the graveknight’s new body. Removing the curse allows a character to remove
    the armor, but if it ever wears the armor again, the curse returns. If the wearer
    dies from another cause while wearing the armor, or if the graveknight’s rejuvenation
    completes before the wearer dies from the curse, the wearer immediately progresses
    to stage 3. **Graveknight’s Curse** (arcane, curse, necromancy) This curse affects
    anyone who wears a graveknight’s armor for at least 1 hour. **Saving Throw** Will
    save; **Onset** 1 hour; **Stage 1** doomed 1 and cannot remove the armor (1 day);
    **Stage 2** doomed 2, hampered 10, and cannot remove the armor (1 day); **Stage
    3** dies and transforms into the armor’s graveknight.'

  description: Griffons are regal beasts revered as symbols of freedom and strength
    in many cultures. They are physically striking, with the hindquarters of a lion
    and the head, wings, and forelimbs of a great bird of prey—typically an eagle,
    but some instead bear the features of a hawk, falcon, or even osprey or vulture.
    In rare cases, the griffon’s hindquarters may resemble those of a different great
    cat, such as a leopard or tiger. The variations seem to conform to the environment
    in which the griffon lives—for instance, the especially rare griffons of northern
    Avistan have the hindquarters of a Grungir lynx and the upper body of a snowy
    owl—though this is not always the case. Some griffons lack wings altogether. These
    wingless griffons, known as alces, result from a rare mutation. Among a clutch
    of other griffons, the alce is typically considered the runt, so few of these
    offshoots survive their fledgling stage. Those alces that do make it to adulthood
    tend to be tougher, more violent, and more aloof than most griffons.

  description: The Grim Reaper is the unflinching personification of death. Silent
    as the grave and as inevitable as time itself, this legendary being hunts down
    and finishes creatures that have evaded death for far too long. Sometimes the
    Grim Reaper comes without warning, while at others it comes to finish the work
    that other creatures could not. The Grim Reaper serves no god, fiend, or aeon.
    It is both despised and feared by psychopomps and celestials, but few—if any—dare
    to stand in its way. Like some eternal plague, it kills those who try to cure
    the multiverse of its presence. It stands alone and holds only its own council,
    and the pleading and reasoning of mortals and immortals alike fall on deaf ears
    once the Grim Reaper closes on its quarry. Its own reasoning is silent to mortal
    ears and inscrutable to the mortal mind, but no matter the reason, the result
    is unyielding and final.

  description: Annis hags are brutal torturers and murderers, delighting in the musical
    screams and tasty flesh of young creatures and those who are pure of heart. Annis
    hags are the most direct of all hags, engaging in physical combat and using their
    change shape ability to hunt rather than to infiltrate and betray humanoids. But
    an Annis hag takes a grisly trophy from each kill and uses it to sow discord,
    sending the trophy to one of her victim’s loved ones in a way that implicates
    another family member in the murder. Also known as iron hags, annis hags have
    iron-like yet flexible flesh that resists edged weapons, and their own touch is
    the same cold iron that burns the flesh of other hags. This allows them to bully
    their way to the leadership of hag covens.

  description: Harpies are filthy amalgamations of human and bird, resembling feral
    humans with wings, talons, and mouths full of sharp teeth. They use captivating
    songs to lure creatures in, then murder them while they stand transfixed. They
    enjoy causing confusion and fear in their prey before they strike, believing it
    creates a savory flavor in the flesh. Harpies can eat most creatures but strongly
    prefer sapient prey—humans and elves are their favorite. Although harpies will
    eat goblins if sufficiently hungry, they dislike their flavor and avoid eating
    them if possible. This doesn’t comfort goblins, of course, who have a particularly
    strong fear of harpies. Because their aeries often reek with the gore of their
    kills and careless spatters of guano, harpies carry a distinctly vile scent that
    canny travelers associate with danger. Harpies who roost close to civilization
    make better efforts to keep clean, though these efforts have mixed results.

      by the harpy’s song. The effect lasts for 1 round, but if the harpy uses this

      affected creatures. Once a creature succeeds at any save against Captivating
      Song, that creature is temporarily immune to Captivating Songs for 24 hours.

      as possible, while avoiding obvious dangers. If a captivated creature is adjacent
      to the harpy, it stays still and doesn’t act. If attacked by the harpy, the
      creature is freed from captivation at the end of the harpy’s turn. **Critical
      Failure** As failure, but if attacked by the harpy, the creature can attempt
      a new save at the start of its next turn, rather than being freed at the end
      of the harpy’s turn.

      homunculus becomes mindless, claims its current location as its lair, and instinctively
      attacks anyone who comes near.

  description: 'A homunculus is a tiny servitor construct created by a crafter to
    serve as a spy, scout, messenger, or assistant. When a crafter first begins to
    study the art of creating constructs, she often crafts a homunculus first, since
    the creation process is simple and inexpensive due to a magical shortcut: the
    use of the creator’s own blood. This forges a link between the homunculus and
    its master, causing the homunculus to gain a spark of the creator’s intellect,
    as well as the same moral values and some of the creator’s basic personality traits.
    Homunculi left to their own devices never stray far from their masters.'

  description: Just as they were cursed long ago, lamias can curse those they touch,
    clouding the mind and regressing conscious thought to purely animalistic instincts.
    Creatures affected by this curse grow reckless, becoming unaware of the consequences
    of their own actions and unable to think clearly. This makes the hapless victim
    all the more susceptible to the lamia’s cunning illusions and insidious charms.
    The lamia’s animalistic nature and the effect of their cursed touch has led some
    scholars to theorize that the original lamias must have, millennia ago, turned
    away from their own reason and intellect and embraced the life of simple beasts.
    Whether this change was rewarded as a monstrous gift from Lamashtu or inflicted
    as a curse for abandoning their responsibilities by Pharasma remains the subject
    of debate to this day.

      Each eye contains an 8th-level spell that targets one creature (usually one
      eye has *maze* and the other *polar ray*). The demilich can Activate an eye.
      This uses the number of spellcasting actions the spell requires, and also requires
      command and envision components. When the demilich casts a spell from a gemstone
      eye, that eye stops glowing for 1d4 rounds, during which time that eye’s spell
      can’t be used. Occasionally, one or both of the two *demilich eye gems* can
      be harvested from a destroyed demilich as magic items.

  description: Large and seemingly ponderous, a monitor lizard is a deceptively swift
    and ruthless predator. It ambushes its prey by rushing out from cover and biting
    the target with its powerful jaws. A giant monitor lizard’s saliva is venomous,
    allowing it to bring down prey larger than it can easily haul away in its jaws.
    Giant monitor lizards grow up to 14 feet long, including their long tails, and
    they weigh about 350 pounds. Their bodies are normally dark brown with patches
    of yellow or green. When nesting, a giant monitor lizard digs a deep burrow to
    hide in. The burrow serves as both a safe haven and a location from which the
    lizard can ambush larger prey such as deer, boars, or even humanoids. A giant
    monitor lizard can consume nearly its own body weight in a single meal, and its
    loosely articulated jaws allow it to swallow surprisingly large prey.

  description: Found in warm and tropical forests and savannas, these immense lizards
    are a deadly threat to the unsuspecting traveler. When they aren’t sleeping or
    stalking prey, giant frilled lizards bask in the sunlight for hours at a time.
    Explorers sometimes mistakenly think them related to dragons due to their large
    size, elaborate neck frills (which, when displayed in a show of aggression and
    dominance, can be mistaken for wings), and ferocious hissing vocalizations used
    to frighten away creatures too large to eat.

  description: Monstrous humanoids that resemble humans with snakes instead of hair,
    medusas are best known for their petrifying gazes that—if lingered upon—can permanently
    transform mortals to stone. Medusas are shrewd and manipulative adversaries who
    collect and covet secrets, and who use threats and guile to exploit the fears
    of weaker creatures. A medusa may seek out powerful magic items, use divination
    magic to discover secret knowledge and unlock forbidden power, or infiltrate a
    society to beguile influential politicians. Their ability to worm their way into
    powerful organizations makes them natural leaders of criminal out  ts and thieves’
    guilds, and their interest in magical phenomena leads some to pursue careers as
    oracles who offer to help adventurers find what they seek—for a price. Of course,
    if wit and deception proves insufficient, a medusa can always simply turn rivals
    into ornate stone decorations with little more than a glare.

  description: The majority of mummies were created by cruel and selfish masters to
    serve as guardians to protect their tombs from intruders. The traditional method
    of creating a mummy guardian is a laborious and sadistic process that begins well
    before the poor soul to be transformed is dead, during which the victim is ritualistically
    starved of nourishing food and instead fed strange spices, preservative agents,
    and toxins intended to quicken the desiccation of the flesh. The victim remains
    immobile but painfully aware during the final stages, where its now-useless entrails
    are extracted before it’s shrouded in funerary wrappings and entombed within a
    necromantically ensorcelled sarcophagus to await intrusions in the potentially
    distant future. While it’s certainly possible to use other methods to create a
    mummy guardian from an already-deceased body, those who seek to create these foul
    undead as their guardians in the afterlife often feel that such methods result
    in inferior undead—the pain and agony of death by mummification being an essential
    step in the process.

  description: While mummy guardians are undead crafted from the corpses of sacrificed—usually
    unwilling victims—and retain only fragments of their memories, a mummy pharaoh
    is the result of a deliberate embrace of undeath by a sadistic and cruel ruler.
    The transformation from life to undeath is no less awful and painful, but as the
    transition is an intentional bid to escape death by a powerful personality who
    fully embraces the blasphemous repercussions of the choice, the mummy pharaoh
    retains its memories and personality intact. Although in most cases a mummy pharaoh
    is formed from a particularly depraved ruler instructing their priests to perform
    complex rituals that grant the ruler eternal unlife, a ruler who was filled with
    incredible anger in life might spontaneously arise from death as a mummy pharaoh
    without undergoing this ritual. Depending on the nature of the ruler, a mummy
    pharaoh might have spellcasting or other class features instead of its Attack
    of Opportunity and disruptive abilities—the exact nature of the abilities the
    ruler had in life can significantly change or strengthen the mummy pharaoh presented
    here (which represents the least powerful variety of this deadly undead foe).

    and wise protectors of places of great natural or supernatural significance: ancient
    oak groves, forgotten holy temples, and vaults of sacred power are just a few
    examples of locations that these nagas protect. Guardian nagas believe that the
    beautiful elements of the cosmos are worthy of protection and that devotion to
    such a grand effort is its own reward. A guardian naga may join a group with similar
    values, such as a sect of priests or monks, to aid it in its holy endeavors and

  description: The sleek, dark niliths resemble hairless, emaciated tree sloths. These
    creatures are intensely dangerous and fearsome, with red glowing eyes, wicked
    claws, and mouths full of needlelike teeth. Niliths feed off the emotions, fears,
    and flesh of the living, and folktales posit that those who have nightmares of
    these creatures are fated to one day be eaten by them. Niliths draw intense joy
    from tormenting sapient creatures, often focusing their predations on the pious
    and the just, from whom they draw forth their most basic fears and worst thoughts
    and revel in their victims’ subsequent terror. More often than not, these despicable
    manipulators wish to drive their victims into madness and even to suicide. Most
    niliths lack the patience to spend too much time fully tearing down an individual,
    and when a nilith tires of its current plaything and becomes bored with its particular
    thoughts and fears, it murders the quarry before feeding on its flesh and moving
    onto the next victim.

  description: Naiads protect streams, ponds, springs, and other natural bodies of
    fresh water. While most naiads lead solitary lives close to their chosen ward,
    sometimes these nymphs congregate in coven-like groups where river tributaries
    meet, performing great magic and blessing the waters of the land. Because naiads’
    bonds to their bodies of water permit more flexibility, they are the nymphs most
    likely to interact with humanoids and even visit their settlements on occasion.
    Unlike other nymphs, naiads occasionally become adventurers, especially when dark
    forces seek to despoil nature or otherwise threaten the land, joining forces with
    others to prevent the corruption of nature.

      while inside as long as the spell doesn’t require a line of effect outside the
      tree. She can hear, but not see, what’s going on outside the tree. She can enter
      or exit her extradimensional domain from any tree in her domain. She can Dismiss
      this effect. Significant physical damage dealt to the tree expels the hamadryad
      from the tree and deals 3d6 damage to her. *Passwall* expels the hamadryad without
      dealing damage. If a dryad uses this ability on her bonded tree, she instead
      enters an extradimensional living space within the tree; Tree Meld gains the
      extradimensional trait. A hamadryad can bring up to eight other creatures with
      her when entering her home within her bonded tree. The hamadryad can still be
      expelled from this space as above.

  description: Ogre gluttons take the act of feeding to a horrific extreme, capable
    of extending their already cavernous mouths wide enough to gulp down a halfling.
    Stories of ogre gluttons being tricked into eating razor-edged shields or barrels
    filled with poisoned meat are common, but such tales are of little consolation
    to those who have been gobbled down whole by these ravenous giants. In addition
    to their sadistic table manners, ogre gluttons have a disturbing knack for coming
    up with violent “games” that are little more than drawn-out torments, yet those
    who somehow manage to beat a glutton at the rules of its own game can often enrage
    and frustrate the ogre enough that the resulting tantrum is more than enough distraction
    to afford a last-ditch escape from doom.

    cannot abide the sight of suffering and deny their succor only to the most foul

  description: Porachas are feline beasts native to the mystical Forest of Spirits
    in Tian Xia. In their natural form, these graceful eight-legged creatures sport
    a gray tabby coat of fur streaked with lines of olive green, but they are rarely
    seen this way. Even the youngest porachas are capable of hiding within objects,
    making them incredibly elusive and rarely seen except on their own terms. Because
    porachas can so effortlessly blend in with the forest and emerge from its dark
    corners in an instant, superstitious locals believe these beasts are related to
    kami—nature spirits who embody individual trees, stones, or other elements of
    nature in the Forest of Spirits. The truth is that while porachas frequently associate
    with kami, they are their own breed of mysterious monster with powers over time
    and space that set them apart from nature spirits.

    eyes are always a piercing shade of amber or violet. Second, the keketar’s mark
    of office—a crown of shifting symbols that hovers above its head—never changes.
    A keketar cannot remove its crown but can suppress it, although most are loath
    to do so and consider such an act one of cowardice or shame.'

    of the Boneyard, witnessing judgments, directing souls, and generally performing
    the administrative grunt work that keeps the Boneyard functioning. Most nosois
    are particularly chatty and eager to discuss how important they consider their

    description: The nosoi croons an entrancing song. Each living or undead creature
      within a 60-foot emanation must attempt a DC 18 Will save. The effect lasts
      for 1 round, but a nosoi can use this ability again on subsequent rounds to
      extend the duration by 1 round for all affected creatures. A creature that succeeds
      at any save is temporarily immune for 24 hours. Despite being a mental effect,
      this ability affects mindless undead. Psychopomps are immune to this ability.
      **Failure** The creature is fascinated. **Critical Failure** As failure, and
      the creature must spend each of its actions on its turn to move closer to the
      nosoi as expediently as possible while avoiding obvious dangers. If a fascinated
      creature is adjacent to the nosoi, it stays still and doesn’t act. If the creature
      is attacked, the fascination ends.

    no act is too terrible or cruel to inflict on its victims, since the more a creature

    redcap women are no less fearsome or cruel. Redcaps are ultimately craven bullies,
    cowed by anything more powerful than themselves, a trait that leads them to fear
    and despise the symbols of good deities. Many fairy tales explain how the redcaps
    draw power from dipping the hats for which they are named in fresh blood. Just
    as iconic to these cruel little fey are their iron-clad boots, and the clanging
    sound of their metal soles clanking on stone floors is both discordant and disconcerting—
    especially to those who recognize the sound for what it is. Redcaps typically
    stand only 3 feet tall, with hunched frames, pointed ears, crooked teeth, and
    long, white, tangled hair.

      The satyr plays a melody on his instrument to cast *charm*, *fear*, *sleep*,
      or *suggestion* without expending the spell slot and using his music in place
      of providing the spell’s component actions. The spell gains the auditory trait
      and targets all creatures in a 60-foot emanation instead of its usual targets.
      A creature that succeeds at its Will save against any spell is then temporarily
      immune from spells played from that satyr’s pipes for 1 minute. Satyrs are immune
      to this music.'

  description: Shamblers are cunning carnivorous plants that resemble heaps of wet,
    rotting vegetation. Even when standing erect on their stumpy legs, shamblers don’t
    have much in the way of identifiable anatomy; they are tangles of parasitic vines
    that lash out at prey with their longest creepers, entwined together to deliver
    powerful blows. Sometimes called “shambling mounds,” these ambush predators have
    a particular fondness for flesh, and are most well known for their ability to
    hunker down and hide in plain sight. A shambler can draw nutrients from plant
    matter or soil, but won’t do so if it suspects meat might soon wander near, and
    indeed may lie in wait for days in anticipation of such a meal.

      ability. The GM determines which creatures are appropriately sinful.
    name: Sin Scent
    traits: null
  description: 'Sinspawn were created by one of seven ancient wizards known collectively
    as runelords—each of whom embraced and embodied one of seven sins. The first sinspawn
    was created by the Runelord of Wrath, utilizing techniques that have since gone
    on to influence fleshwarping practices. It wasn’t long before the technique used
    to create sinspawn fell into the hands of the other runelords, and while each
    tried their own hand at crafting variants of their own design, today sinspawn
    of wrath remain the most numerous and notorious of their kind. Bearing only a
    vague resemblance to the humanoids from whose flesh they were formed, sinspawn
    generally appear horrifically emaciated and have unnaturally long arms and digitigrade
    legs, each with a trio of stubby, taloned digits. Veins bulge across sinspawn’s
    bodies in sanguine patterns that suspiciously resemble twisted runes, and their
    flesh is pale and hairless. Their heads are elongated, bearing only slits for
    a nose, red eyes, and disturbing lower jaws that split in half at the chin, revealing
    pedipalps that end in tiny, three-fingered hands and framing a long, lolling tongue.
    Sinspawn stand 6-1/2 feet tall and typically weigh as much as an emaciated human
    of their size. They behave in a manner consistent with their associated sin and
    have physical characteristics that hint at these qualities. For example, greedspawn’s
    veins appear to run with gold while envyspawn appear even more wasted than the
    rest of their kin.<h2 class="title">Sinspawn Sins</h2> When a sinspawn is created,
    it becomes associated with one of the seven sins: envoy, gluttony, greed, lust,
    pride, sloth, or wrath. A sinspawn’s sin is determined by the *runewell* that

    name: Personality Fragments
    traits: null
  description: Soulbound dolls are eerie mannequins or playthings that have been imbued
    with a small piece of a deceased mortal’s soul. These little constructs are created
    for a variety of reasons—such as to serve as companions or servants—but their
    free will means their obedience to their creators is hardly a given. Followers
    of Pharasma generally abhor soulbound dolls, viewing them as a perversion of the
    natural cycle of souls, and those who worship the Lady of Graves see the destruction
    of a soulbound doll, regardless of the construct’s alignment, as an important
    service to the Great Beyond. Soulbound dolls are the simplest in a series of soulbound
    constructs including human-sized soulbound mannequins, powerful soulbound shells,
    and sentinel soulbound terra-cotta warriors. Creating them from unwilling living
    creatures is evil, and an unwilling donor can resist the process with a successful
    Will save against the creator’s Craft DC, ruining the doll if not preventing the
    donor’s death. A non-evil doll can only be crafted from the soul of a person who
    has given consent to such use before their death occurred

  description: Common sprites are primeval guardians that latch onto a person, place,
    or object and defend it for their own inscrutable reasons. Their dispositions
    vary from kind to spiteful, but all sprites have a capricious streak. Being only
    about 9 inches tall, they are wary of animals that might hunt them, particularly
    house cats, and prefer flight to a fight. On the other hand, sprites are incredibly
    curious about all forms of magic and heedlessly gather around ley line nexuses
    or other places of power.

    roar that can send would-be predators scurrying off. Troll kings possess a cunning
    far beyond their younger kin— they know to keep their allies close, and their
    enemies even closer. If a troll king so much as suspects that one of its followers
    is plotting to usurp it, retribution is swift and fatal.

  description: Symbols of grace and purity, unicorns resemble proud and noble horses.
    They are typically pure white of coat, but they are best known for the single,
    delicate horn that extends from the center of their forehead. While unicorns often
    serve as protectors of unspoiled wilderness and sacred places, they are themselves
    highly sought after for their horns, which are said to possess potent magical
    properties. To many, the mere idea of hunting such a magnificent creature in the
    hopes of severing its horn is utterly reprehensible. Indeed, a de-horned unicorn
    is a sorry sight, and few such unicorns survive much longer in the wild.

  description: Fertilized by large quantities of spilled blood, such as that found
    on bloodstained battlefields or in the war-torn regions surrounding besieged cities,
    wemmuths are vile swaths of vines that draw sustenance from mortal suffering,
    lapping up blood like water. Possessing a rudimentary intelligence and an unquenchable
    thirst for blood, wemmuths lie in wait for most of their lives, growing to incredible
    size in the bloody soil of their grisly homes. Though the vines that comprise
    a wemmuth’s body are scarcely thicker than rope, a single adult wemmuth system
    consists of 6 tons of vines, enough to stretch for 6,000 feet if stretched from
    end to end in a single straight line. Wemmuths never orient themselves this way,
    however, instead preferring to wrap themselves into massive mounds approximately
    15 feet across and equally thick. Although wemmuths are often spotted lazing about,
    the scent of blood is enough to whip one into a violent frenzy. The creature condenses
    its entire mass into a sphere of sharp thorns and lashing vines, resembling a
    hateful tumbleweed the size of an elephant. Wemmuths commonly dig up massive boulders
    or entire trees from the ground and incorporate them into their rolling mass,
    using these objects to bolster their defense against many forms of attack or hurling
    them at faraway foes with terrifying precision.

    of crowds and countless rat-holes make ghettos and shantytowns favored homes for
    wererats, especially since in these poorer districts the wererat can kill out
    of greed or fear with little chance of the authorities noticing. In some cities,
    wererats operate entire thieves’ guilds or organized crime rings, and membership
    requires willfully submitting to the wererat’s cursed bite. Wererats look very
    similar to ratfolk when in hybrid form, apart from potential differences in size,
    but ratfolk have no love for these monsters.

  description: Unlike many other types of werecreature, a werebear does not become
    malevolent during its involuntary transformations, but is instead filled with
    righteous conviction. This indignation can still manifest in violent ways, though,
    as a transformed werebear becomes temporarily blind to its alliances and has little
    control over its bestial temper. As a result, werebears are loners, rarely even
    living together as families longer than necessary. Werebears know that as long
    as they live solitary lives, they can serve as protectors and guardians in wilderness
    regions without the overwhelming fear that, when the moon is full and the curse
    takes hold, they will rage against an innocent bystander or loved one. As long
    as there is nothing around to threaten it or the natural area it protects (typically
    a forest), a werebear in its animal form is generally content to forage and sleep
    away the night.

    light in the distance isn’t, in fact, leading them to safety. Even invisible,

    multiply by consuming and transforming the living into more of their foul kind—meaning
    a handful of wraiths left unchecked can easily turn into a horde of darkness.

  description: Zaramuuns are beings of elemental sand that hide in deserts and wastelands.
    They disguise themselves as massive dunes before rising up to attack living creatures.
    The most infamous zaramuuns kill any living creatures they find, but others simply
    rob their victims of all metal and stone possessions before fleeing. Although
    zaramuuns insist they are only reclaiming what was taken from their ancestral
    earth, this is simple self-delusion; most zaramuuns use their stolen goods as
    payment and material components to conjure fiends, for Zaramuuns were exiled from
    the Plane of Earth after worshipping fiends who promised to give them power over
    other elementals. This worship gradually transformed into servitude, and now many
    zaramuuns believe that if they send enough souls to their masters, they will be
    set free.

  description: Grauladons are vicious predators that appear crocodilian in form, but
    are in fact distant offshoots of dragonkind. They make their dens in the shallows
    of fetid ponds or isolated corners of larger bodies of water, usually in rural
    swamps or woodlands. Driven almost entirely by their base desire to feed, grauladons
    spend most of their time swimming leisurely underwater looking for prey such as
    fish or waterfowl. Possessed of a greed befitting their more majestic dragon cousins,
    grauladons often take down prey larger than they need, jealously guarding the
    corpses to keep scavengers away even as the meat rots. A typical grauladon is
    16 feet long from its snout to the tip of its tail and weighs 1,500 pounds.

  description: The life of a Hellknight is bloody, brutal, and often short. Many who
    perish in service to a Hellknight order are glad to rest after having served their
    masters so faithfully, but others seek to continue their work even in death. When
    a Hellknight is decapitated, the ghostly undead known as a hellcrown is an occasional
    result. Consumed by the desire to bring about order by inflicting cruelty, hellcrowns
    haunt battlefields and abandoned castles, slaying all they encounter. A strange
    fusion of spirit and steel, a hellcrown has no corporeal form by itself, but instead
    inhabits the helmet it so proudly wore in life. Dangling from the helmet like
    a shroud is a shadow of the former Hellknight’s spine, adding to the creature’s
    terrifyingly gruesome appearance. Hellknights regard hellcrowns with a mixture
    of disgust and respect, considering the individuals who transform into these floating
    undead to have been resolute in purpose but weak in body.

    the odd adventurer or spelunker who stumbles into their nest.

  description: Kishi are duplicitous and murderous fey who dwell on the edges of Golarion’s
    darkest jungles. At first glance, kishi appear to be attractive humans, usually
    of a local ethnicity, but their full heads of thick hair conceal a second face,
    that of a snarling hyena. When a kishi lures their prey into a vulnerable situation,
    their head swivels around, revealing this fearsome visage. In this form, a kishi’s
    powerful jaws are almost impossible to pry loose and can crush a victim’s bones
    in a matter of moments. Kishi are highly varied in their physical features, and
    their height and weight are as variable as the people whose communities they infiltrate.

  description: The tall sharinga trees of the Mwangi Expanse leak golden sap from
    their swollen, bulbous trunks, which coagulates when exposed to air. The toxic
    resin, which has a bitter taste, protects the tree from herbivorous insects and
    other animals, but in rare cases—usually in areas awash in positive energy or
    the influence of the First World—the sap gains a life of its own. Such “living
    sap” is a mindless ooze that attempts to smother and engulf just about anything
    that moves, from the bugs and small beasts that feed on its sharinga tree to larger
    creatures unlucky enough to stumble upon it. Due to its immunities to most forms
    of physical damage and its protectiveness of its mother tree, a living ooze is
    a nuisance to communities that rely on the sap of sharinga trees to make resin,
    rubber, and glue.

  description: Kalavakuses work as slavers in the Abyss, earning them the alternate
    moniker of “slaver demons”; these fiends round up captured victims and sell them
    to other fiends or unscrupulous mortals. Pleas for freedom or clemency fall on
    deaf ears, as slaver demons consider anyone they can catch and hold to be their
    rightful property and theirs to sell. Kalavakuses know more than just physical
    means of restraining slaves; they also know how to fetter a victim’s soul. The
    most successful slaver demons have vast slave-pits in the Abyss where they keep
    stables of imprisoned souls.

    description: The demon enslaves the soul of a living creature within 60 feet.
      The target can attempt to resist this enslavement with a DC 29 Will save. A
      slaver demon can have only one living soul enslaved with this ability at a time,
      and no more than one slaver demon can enslave the same soul. If a slaver demon
      kills a creature whose soul it has enslaved, the demon regains 20 HP and the
      soul is consigned to an eternity of toil in the Abyss, adding to the slaver
      demon’s tally of souls and allowing the demon to enslave another. **Success**
      The target avoids being enslaved and is temporarily immune for 24 hours. **Failure**
      The target is enslaved and is enfeebled 2 for 24 hours or until the slaver demon
      is slain, whichever comes first. **Critical Failure** As failure, and the target
      also suffers the effects of a failed saving throw against *dominate*.

  description: Perhaps more than any other devil, osyluths—also known as bone devils—
    embrace the torture and sadism for which Hell is so well known. They are exemplary
    inquisitors with an unwavering devotion to Hell’s laws and hierarchy, and they
    seek out heresies among mortals and devilkind with equal vigor. These devils arise
    from the Styx-fed swamps of Stygia, Hell’s fifth layer, from the stagnant energy
    of long-dead heresies. Left to their own devices, osyluths build massive, calcified
    hives in Stygia’s remote corners and hunt the infernal swampland for lesser devils
    and petitioners.

  description: Shadow giants are natives of the Plane of Shadow, where they have dwelled
    in perpetual twilight for millennia. Their cultures vary greatly depending on
    whether the giants reside in their land of origin or have relocated to the Material
    Plane. On the Plane of Shadow, they live in familial groups and uphold a nomadic
    way of life as they roam across vast ancestral lands between forests of shadow
    and misty chasms. These hunter-gatherers pass their lore down through oral histories,
    conduct pilgrimages to unholy ziggurats of black stone, and bathe in the blood
    of their long-standing foes, including rival shadow giant tribes and velstracs
    intent on enslaving their kind. On the Material Plane, conversely, they are typically
    secretive and isolationist, keeping apart from other peoples.

  description: Interlocutors are the most talented surgeon-sculptors of the velstracs,
    carving away flesh and replacing it with new body parts of muscle, sinew, and
    metal. Few interlocutors resemble one another, but all are towering, multi-limbed
    amalgamations of the strongest limbs, densest bone, and sharpest metal they can
    find. They continually search for new material to graft to their forms, and their
    slain foes are rarely found intact, as little is more valuable to interlocutors

      it. To non-deculis, the extradimensional space looks like an ordinary area of
      darkness (though effects such as *true seeing* can see through this illusion).
      The deculi’s infrared vision functions normally between this extradimensional
      space and the area outside its confines, allowing the deculi to sense what is
      going on around it, and its innate *darkness* spell also extends to the area
      around the shadow sanctuary. Attacks cannot be made into or from the extradimensional
      space. The deculi can Dismiss this effect to emerge from its shadow sanctuary,
      but the space it emerges into must be in darkness and must be unobstructed.
      If the area is obstructed, the deculi is shunted to the nearest available space
      and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 5 feet shunted. If the area overlaying
      the shadow sanctuary becomes illuminated by magical light, the extradimensional
      space can no longer be accessed and the deculi is trapped within until the area
      is once again in darkness. The deculi can try to extinguish a magical light
      effect obscuring its sanctuary once per day by attempting to counteract the
      light effect with its *darkness* innate spell. If a deculi dies (including from
      hunger, thirst, or asphyxiation) while within the extradimensional space, the
      shadow sanctuary immediately ends and the deculi’s corpse is expelled. If the

  description: Witchwyrds are four-armed humanoid creatures with hairless blue-gray
    skin and glowing yellow eyes. They are typically 6-1/2 feet tall and weigh 300
    pounds. Their hands possess three evenly sized and spaced digits in a tripod-like
    arrangement. Witchwyrds conceal most of their faces, leaving only their eyes unmasked.
    Their inscrutability is a boon to one of their most significant interests, mercantilism,
    and many haughty witchwyrds openly revel in the befuddlement inspired by their
    mysterious guises and mannerisms. Witchwyrds have a keen eye for new opportunities
    and markets, and a witchwyrd almost always knows when someone is trying to pull
    one over on them.
